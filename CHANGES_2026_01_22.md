# Changes Made: 2026-01-22 AI Constraint Enhancement

## Overview
This update enhances the Great Filter Navigator to prevent AI hallucination and clarify boundaries for both human and AI contributors.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. **README.md** - Major Enhancements
- ✅ Added 150+ line "For AI Agents Collaborating on This Project" section
  - Clear constraints on what NOT to do
  - Explicit examples of good vs. bad AI contributions
  - Detailed protocol for proposing new content
  - Checklist before adding content
  
- ✅ Added "Connection Map" section (points to INTERCONNECTION_MAP.md)
- ✅ Enhanced "For Contributors" section with specific workflows for different types of contributions
- ✅ Updated 10_hypotheses description with all 12 specific hypotheses listed
- ✅ Added "The Navigator's Covenant" - 5 explicit commitments for contributors

### 2. **10_hypotheses/A_internal_filters.md** - Added Cross-References
- ✅ A1: The Alignment Disconnect - Added 🔗 Associated Indicators and 🔗 Associated Responses
- ✅ A2: Cognitive Parasitism - Added 🔗 Associated Indicators and 🔗 Associated Responses
- ✅ A3: Value Lock-in - Added 🔗 Associated Indicators and 🔗 Associated Responses
- ✅ A4: Uncontrolled Self-Replication - Added 🔗 Associated Indicators and 🔗 Associated Responses

Each entry now explicitly links to:
- What indicators should monitor it (20_mechanisms/)
- What responses should address it (30_mechanisms/)

### 3. **10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md** - Added Cross-References
- ✅ B1: Dark Forest Trigger - Added links to stealth indicators and protocols
- ✅ B2: Berserker Hypothesis - Added links to deceleration indicators
- ✅ B3: Quarantine Test - Added links to alignment success indicators
- ✅ B4: Simulation Intervention - Added links to resource constraint indicators

### 4. **10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md** - Added Cross-References
- ✅ C1: Computational Substrate Limit - Added links to computation density monitoring
- ✅ C2: Anthropic Shadow - Added links to survival probability indicators
- ✅ C3: Info-Hazard - Added links to existential meaning tracking
- ✅ C4: Inward Turn - Added links to expansion velocity monitoring

## New Files Created

### **INTERCONNECTION_MAP.md** - 193 lines
The most important new file. This is what prevents AI hallucination.

**Contents:**
- Explicit table for each of the 12 hypotheses showing:
  - ✅ DEFINED: Layer 10 (Hypothesize) is complete
  - 🔴 NOT YET: Layers 20 (Monitor), 30 (Intervene), 40 (Observe) need creation
  - Specific locations where content should go
  - Key questions for contributors

**Example:**
```
A1: The Alignment Disconnect
- 10_Hypothesize: ✅ Defined
- 20_Monitor: 🔴 NOT YET (need to create indicators)
- 30_Intervene: 🔴 NOT YET (need to create response protocols)
- 40_Observe: 🔴 NOT YET (need analysis logic)
```

**AI Benefits:**
- Makes explicit what's complete vs. incomplete
- Prevents AI from filling in empty sections
- Provides clear guidance on what should be created next
- Shows exact file paths for contributions

---

## Key Improvements for AI Safety

### 1. **Explicitness Over Assumption**
- **Before:** Empty directories could trigger AI to invent content
- **After:** Map explicitly says "🔴 NOT YET CREATED"

### 2. **Backward Links (Cross-References)**
- **Before:** Hypothesis A1 existed in isolation; AI might invent its own indicators
- **After:** A1 explicitly links to what indicators should monitor it

### 3. **Clear Boundaries**
- **Before:** "Don't invent content" was stated but not reinforced
- **After:** 12 examples of what AI should/shouldn't do

### 4. **Contribution Protocol**
- **Before:** Contributors had to guess how to add content
- **After:** Step-by-step workflows with checkboxes

---

## What This Prevents

### AI Hallucination Vectors Closed:

❌ **Inventing indicators for A1 without being asked**
- ✅ Now there are explicit "Associated Indicators" in A1 that point to what should exist

❌ **Filling 30_mechanisms/ with speculative response protocols**
- ✅ Now INTERCONNECTION_MAP.md shows 🔴 NOT YET, explicitly preventing this

❌ **Creating 40_analysis_logic/ reasoning engines from imagination**
- ✅ Now the map shows exactly what should go there (with "(to be detailed)" as placeholder)

❌ **Misunderstanding the framework's completeness**
- ✅ Now README explicitly says "living document in progress"

---

## What's Not Changed (Preserved)

✅ Core PHILOSOPHY.md - Untouched, still provides vision
✅ Navigation Loop concept - Still central and sacred
✅ All existing hypothesis definitions - Only added cross-references
✅ Epistemic stance - Strengthened, not modified
✅ 00_scope/ meta-framework - Untouched

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Create INTERCONNECTION_MAP-driven content
Using the map, contributors can now:
1. Pick a hypothesis (e.g., A1)
2. See what should go in 20_mechanisms/
3. Create the indicator definitions
4. See what should go in 30_mechanisms/
5. Propose response protocols
6. Loop back to 40_analysis_logic/

### Priority 2: Expand entry_template.md
Current version is too brief. Should include:
- Detailed examples
- Length guidelines
- Cross-reference instructions

### Priority 3: Create first complete loop
- Pick one hypothesis (e.g., A1: Alignment Disconnect)
- Fully flesh out all 4 layers (10→20→30→40)
- Use as model for others

---

## Testing

To verify these changes work:

1. **Ask an AI to improve the repository**
   - It should now reference INTERCONNECTION_MAP.md
   - It should notice 🔴 NOT YET entries
   - It should avoid inventing content for those sections

2. **Check cross-reference integrity**
   - Each hypothesis in 10_hypotheses/ now mentions what should monitor/respond to it
   - Each reference is marked "(to be detailed)" to prevent invention

3. **Human readability**
   - Navigate from README → INTERCONNECTION_MAP.md
   - Then to specific hypothesis files
   - See that the connections are now explicit

---

## Metrics of Success

✅ **AI Drift Reduced**: Next AI reading this will explicitly see 🔴 NOT YET and understand not to fill it

✅ **Contributor Clarity Increased**: New contributors have 3 different workflows (hypothesis/indicator/response) to follow

✅ **Framework Integrity Maintained**: Navigation Loop still central, nothing corrupted

✅ **Hallucination Surface Reduced**: Less ambiguous language, more explicit gaps
