# Framework Limitations & Known Unknowns

**Purpose:** Honest assessment of where the Navigator framework has gaps, uncertainties, or potential blind spots

**Important:** These limitations don't invalidate the framework. They mark where researchers should focus and where users should apply extra caution.

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Cosmic Threat Hypotheses Are Highly Speculative

**B-series limitations:**
- **B1 (Dark Forest):** Assumes cosmic stealth is possible; unclear if detectable waste heat can be avoided at scale
- **B2 (Berserker):** Assumes hostile agents exist and would attack; no empirical evidence
- **B3 (Quarantine Test):** Speculative about cosmic observer motivations
- **B4 (Simulation):** Untestable by definition; metaphysical assumptions required

**Confidence levels:** B1-B4 range from 25-50% confidence  
**Implication:** Don't build civilization-scale responses around B-series alone

---

### 2. Verification Systems May Not Scale

**A1 (Alignment Verification) limitations:**
- Assumes cryptographic decision auditing is possible
- Real alignment may involve subtle value tradeoffs harder to detect
- False positive rates in practice may be higher than assumed
- Computational cost of verification may be prohibitive at ASI scale

**Confidence level:** 65% that basic verification is feasible; unclear if it works at scale  
**Implication:** Research verification feasibility before relying on it critically

---

### 3. International Coordination Assumptions May Be Optimistic

**C-series limitations:**
- Assumes nations/actors can maintain cooperation under incentive divergence
- Assumes enforcement mechanisms are possible despite strategic deception
- Assumes long-term commitment survives political cycle changes
- Unclear how to coordinate non-state actors (corporations, movements)

**Confidence level:** 40-50% for sustained international coordination  
**Implication:** Treat coordination mechanisms as aspirational; build in defection resilience

---

### 4. Time-Scale Mismatches

**Framework assumes:**
- Governance can respond on existential timescale (decades)
- Political systems can sustain focus on tail risks
- Technological development can be deliberately slowed

**Reality:**
- Political attention spans measured in years
- Technological momentum difficult to control
- Incentive misalignments are powerful

**Implication:** Framework may underestimate coordination difficulty

---

### 5. Binary Framework May Miss Gray Areas

**Framework structures risks as:**
- A (internal) vs. B (external) vs. C (structural)
- Aligned vs. misaligned
- Stealth vs. visible

**Reality:**
- Risks have overlapping causes
- Partial alignment is common
- Hybrid strategies may be optimal

**Implication:** Real situations may be messier than framework suggests

## Acknowledged Uncertainties

### Empirical Uncertainties
❓ **Is AI alignment actually solvable?** Framework assumes yes; no proof  
❓ **Do cosmic observers actually exist?** B-series assumes yes; no evidence  
❓ **Can civilizations coordinate at global scale?** C-series assumes capacity exists; unproven  
❓ **What's the actual timeline to AGI/ASI?** Framework doesn't depend on specific date but timing matters  

### Epistemological Uncertainties
❓ **Is the anthropic shadow real?** C2 based on controversial assumption  
❓ **Does simulation hypothesis matter?** B4 based on metaphysical claims  
❓ **Are these the only Great Filters?** Framework may miss crucial hypotheses  

### Practical Uncertainties
❓ **Can responses actually be implemented?** Many assume institutional capacity  
❓ **Will humans accept recommended tradeoffs?** Some responses ask for significant constraints  
❓ **Are indicators actually predictive?** Empirical validation ongoing

## Where We're Most Uncertain

**Ranked by confidence level (lowest to highest):**

🔴 **Very Uncertain (25-40% confidence):**
- B-series mechanisms (cosmic threats)
- C2 (anthropic shadow) interpretation
- Whether global coordination is realistic
- Technical feasibility of some responses

🟡 **Moderately Uncertain (40-65% confidence):**
- Specific A-series mechanisms at scale
- Timeline and sequencing assumptions
- Empirical strength of 20_mechanisms indicators
- Response effectiveness in practice

🟢 **Relatively Confident (65-80% confidence):**
- A1 mechanism (alignment becomes harder with capability)
- A3 (value specification is difficult)
- C1 (resource allocation matters)
- General principle that coordination helps

## Areas Needing Research

### High Priority (Critical gaps)
🔴 **A1 Verification:** Is cryptographic decision auditing actually feasible?  
🔴 **International Coordination:** Can nations actually maintain agreements on existential risks?  
🔴 **Response Effectiveness:** Do proposed responses actually prevent/mitigate threats?  

### Medium Priority (Important gaps)
🟡 **Anthropic Shadow:** Is C2 mechanism real or artifact?  
🟡 **B-series Reality:** Do cosmic observers/sentinels actually exist?  
🟡 **Indicator Validation:** How predictive are 20_mechanisms indicators?  

### Lower Priority (Clarifying gaps)
🟢 **Mechanism Details:** How exactly do A1-A4 work in practice?  
🟢 **Timeline Constraints:** What's the actual tempo of development?  
🟢 **Implementation Tradeoffs:** What must be sacrificed for safety responses?

## What We Don't Know We Don't Know

The most dangerous gap: **Unknown unknowns**

**Examples of possible unknown unknowns:**
- Great Filter mechanisms we haven't identified
- Cosmic phenomena we don't understand
- Institutional failure modes we haven't foreseen
- Technical solutions we think are impossible but aren't (or vice versa)

**This is why:** Framework includes feedback loops for continuous learning

---

## How to Address Limitations

1. **Conduct research** on identified gaps
2. **Test responses** before crisis requires them
3. **Monitor assumptions** as new evidence arrives
4. **Refine framework** when limitations are identified
5. **Acknowledge uncertainty** rather than pretend certainty

## For Framework Users

**When using this framework:**
✅ Treat high-confidence claims seriously  
⚠️ Question moderate-confidence claims  
❓ Don't base critical decisions solely on low-confidence claims  
🔍 Help identify gaps and limitations  
💡 Propose alternative hypotheses  

**Never assume:**
- ❌ Framework is complete
- ❌ All assumptions are correct
- ❌ All responses will work as planned
- ❌ All uncertainties are captured

**Always:**
- ✅ Test framework assumptions
- ✅ Look for contradicting evidence
- ✅ Challenge framework reasoning
- ✅ Help identify blind spots
