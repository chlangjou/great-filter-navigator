# 50_application_guides | The Practitioner's Compass

> **"Theory without practice is sterile; practice without theory is blind."**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory bridges the gap between the **Navigator Framework** (layers 10-40) and **real-world application**. It provides actionable guidance for different stakeholder groups on how to understand, validate, and apply the Great Filter hypotheses and risk indicators to their specific domains.

This is where the framework becomes **operational and relevant** to decision-makers, researchers, and practitioners.

---

## 📚 Core Question

**"How do I use this framework?"**

Unlike layers 10-40 which define the theoretical scaffold (hypotheses, indicators, responses, analysis), this layer answers:
- "I'm a policymaker—how does this help me?"
- "I'm a researcher—how do I validate these hypotheses?"
- "I'm an AI developer—how do I apply this to alignment?"
- "I'm a governance body—what action should we take?"

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

### [stakeholder_guides/](./stakeholder_guides/)
Tailored guidance for different user groups:

- **for_policymakers.md** — How to interpret Great Filter risks in policy contexts
- **for_researchers.md** — How to design studies validating 10_hypotheses or 20_mechanisms
- **for_ai_developers.md** — How to integrate alignment insights from the framework
- **for_governance_bodies.md** — How to coordinate civilizational-level responses

### [case_studies/](./case_studies/)
Real-world validation of the framework:

- **historical_filters.md** — Great Filter mechanisms observed in human history
- **near_misses.md** — Times humanity nearly triggered a filter
- **contemporary_analysis.md** — Current state assessment against A/B/C hypotheses

### [current_assessment/](./current_assessment/)
Real-time snapshot of civilization's position:

- **threat_status.md** — Current evaluation of proximity to each A/B/C hypothesis
- **indicator_review.md** — Status of key 20_mechanisms indicators

## 🔗 How This Layer Completes the Navigation Loop

```
10_hypotheses (Theory: What could go wrong?)
        ↓
20_mechanisms (Detection: How do we measure?)
        ↓
30_responses (Action: What do we do?)
        ↓
40_analysis_logic (Reasoning: How do we evaluate?)
        ↓
50_application_guides (Practice: How do we apply it?)
        ↓
[Feedback loops back to 10 for hypothesis refinement]
```

**This layer closes the loop** by:
1. Translating abstract frameworks into concrete guidance
2. Showing how different stakeholders apply the framework
3. Validating framework coherence through real-world examples
4. Generating feedback that improves 10-40 layers

## 🌉 Design Principles for This Layer

### 1. **Clarity Over Completeness**
Provide actionable guidance even if the framework isn't perfect. Users need direction, not perfection.

### 2. **Multiple Entry Points**
Different stakeholders have different needs. Avoid forcing everyone through the same path.

### 3. **Grounding in Reality**
Every application guide should reference real examples and case studies. Theory detached from reality misleads.

### 4. **Feedback Generation**
This layer should raise questions that loop back to 10-40. "Your framework doesn't account for X" is valuable data.

### 5. **No Prescriptive Overreach**
We propose frameworks, not mandates. Users decide what to do with this guidance.

### 6. **Epistemic Honesty**
Acknowledge uncertainty, limitations, and disagreements. Practitioners deserve honesty.

## 🔄 Feedback Loop Integration

When using this layer, you may notice:
- Hypotheses (10_) that don't apply to your domain
- Indicators (20_) that are hard to measure
- Responses (30_) with unintended consequences
- Analysis frameworks (40_) that miss key considerations

**Please feed this back:**
- Open an Issue tagged `[APPLICATION_FEEDBACK]`
- Propose refinements to 10-40 layers
- Share case studies that validate or challenge the framework

This layer is how the Navigator **learns and improves**.

## 🚀 Contributing to This Layer

### Proposing a New Stakeholder Guide
1. Identify a user group not yet covered
2. Tag an Issue with `[NEW_STAKEHOLDER_GUIDE]`
3. Describe: What questions does this group need answered?
4. Propose: What guidance would help them apply the framework?

### Submitting a Case Study
1. Identify a historical event or contemporary issue
2. Map it to 10_hypotheses (which filter does it relate to?)
3. Tag an Issue with `[NEW_CASE_STUDY]`
4. Document: How does the framework explain this case?

### Feedback on Framework Application
1. Use the framework in your domain
2. Note where it works and where it breaks

## 🎯 The Mission

This layer transforms the Navigator from a **theoretical system** into a **practical guide for civilization-scale decision-making**.

It asks: *"Given all we know about the Great Filter, what should humanity actually do?"*

And it answers: *"Here's how different groups can apply this framework in their own context."*
