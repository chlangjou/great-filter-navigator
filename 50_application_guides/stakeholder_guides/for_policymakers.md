# For Policymakers: Using the Navigator Framework

**Purpose:** Guide for policy leaders integrating Great Filter insights into governance decisions

**Your Role:** You translate framework insights into actual policy and institutional mechanisms. Your feedback helps us understand what's realistic vs. theoretical.

---

## 🎯 How to Apply the Framework to Policy

### Step 1: Identify Your Decision Area

Where could the Navigator framework inform your decisions?
- Risk assessment for emerging technologies
- International coordination agreements
- Long-term institutional planning
- Resource allocation for existential risk mitigation
- Alignment standards for advanced AI systems

**Example:** "Our government is deciding whether to sign an international AI governance treaty"

---

### Step 2: Map to Framework Hypotheses

Which Great Filter risks apply to your decision?
- A1-A4: Alignment and control of AI systems
- B1-B4: External threats and cosmic risks
- C1-C4: Civilizational coordination and resources

**Example:** "AI governance treaty maps to A1/A2 (alignment) and C1 (coordination)"

---

### Step 3: Review Proposed Responses

Check 30_responses for relevant intervention strategies:
- What does the framework recommend?
- What are the success criteria (40_analysis_logic)?
- What are the practical challenges?

**Example:** "Response A1 suggests verification systems; response C4 suggests transparency"

---

### Step 4: Assess Practical Feasibility

Consider:
- **Political reality:** Is this politically possible?
- **Implementation cost:** Resources and time required?
- **International coordination:** Need agreement from other nations?
- **Unintended consequences:** What could go wrong?

**Document what works and what doesn't.**

---

### Step 5: Report Back

Create file in `stakeholder_guides/`: `policymaker_feedback_[domain]_[date].md`

**What to include:**
- Which framework elements you applied
- What worked in practice
- What gaps or challenges emerged
- Suggestions for framework refinement
- Real-world constraints the framework didn't anticipate

---

## 💡 Policy Application Examples

### Example 1: AI Governance Treaty
**Framework:** A1 (alignment), C4 (coordination)  
**Challenge:** International enforcement difficult; nations defect  
**Feedback:** "Framework assumes stronger coordination capacity than realistic"

### Example 2: Biosecurity Regulations
**Framework:** B1/B2 (external threats)  
**Challenge:** Balancing research freedom vs. safety  
**Feedback:** "Framework doesn't address innovation-safety tradeoff adequately"

### Example 3: Long-term Research Funding
**Framework:** C1 (resource allocation)  
**Challenge:** Short-term political pressures vs. long-term needs  
**Feedback:** "Framework's timeline assumptions unrealistic for democratic budgets"

## 📊 Key Policy Insights from Navigator

**Implications for your work:**
- Alignment of advanced AI is now a civilizational priority (A1-A4)
- International coordination on existential risks is critical (C-series)
- Early warning indicators should inform resource allocation (20_mechanisms)
- Response protocols should be tested before crisis (30_responses)

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Read** relevant hypothesis and response files
2. **Discuss** with policy team how they apply to your decisions
3. **Implement** where feasible
4. **Document** what you learn
5. **Share** feedback via Issues or stakeholder guide files
