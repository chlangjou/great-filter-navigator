# 🏛️ Project Context & Strategic Backbone

**Project name:** `great-filter-navigator`  
**One-line description:** A structured catalog of civilization-scale risks, failure modes, and response patterns under uncertainty.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is a **catalog and decision notebook**, not a grand theory. Its purpose is to:
- Organize arguments and assumptions about civilization-scale risks.
- Make uncertainty, irreversibility, and failure modes explicit.
- Provide material that is **human-readable and machine-indexable**.
- Preserve reasoning trails so ideas can be revised rather than silently replaced.

## ⚡ The Strategic Backbone: The Wager

The "Navigator" operates on the principle of **Robustness under Radical Uncertainty**. We evaluate our strategy based on the potential cost of being wrong about the universe's nature:

| Scenario | Hypothesis | Strategy | Cost of Being Wrong |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | Universe is Empty (Rare Earth) | Bold Expansion | 🔴 Infinite (May trigger hidden filters) |
| **B** | Universe is Hostile (Dark Forest) | Stealth & Alignment | 🟡 Finite (Missed growth opportunity) |

**Conclusion:** The optimal strategy is to prioritize **Alignment and Information Security** until civilization reaches a maturity threshold.

## 🌌 Background and Motivation

This project was born from a need for **durable, gatekeeper-free knowledge artifacts**. 

Initial attempts to publish AI alignment analysis on traditional forums were restricted due to evolving policies on AI-assisted writing. This project pivots toward:
- **Durable artifacts** over ephemeral posts.
- **Transparent assumptions** over polished conclusions.
- **Open revision** via version control.

The working hypothesis is that structured knowledge is more robust under rapid change than forum-based discourse.

## 🧭 Updated Repository Structure (v2.0)

The repository has evolved from a static risk list into a dynamic navigation system:

### [00_scope/](./00_scope/)
**The Framework**: Definitions, ethical boundaries, and epistemic status. 
- *Key files:* `epistemic_status.md`, `what_would_change_our_minds.md`.

### [10_hypotheses/](./10_hypotheses/)
**The Filter Map**: Categorized civilization-scale failure modes.
- **Category A (Internal):** AI Alignment, Cognitive Stagnation, Value Lock-in.
- **Category B (External):** Dark Forest Triggers, Automated Sentinels.
- **Category C (Structural):** Computation Limits, Simulation Interventions.

### [20_mechanisms/](./20_mechanisms/)
**The Dashboard**: Indicators and detection systems.
- Focus: Monitoring technosignatures, AI capability jumps, and resource thresholds.

### [30_responses/](./30_responses/)
**The Protocols**: Strategic playbooks and response patterns.
- Includes: Decentralization, redundancy, "slow down" protocols, and tail-risk controls.

### [40_analysis_logic/](./40_analysis_logic/)
**The Reasoning Engine**: Reusable abstractions for risk assessment.
- Focus: Time competition, irreversibility, and decision criteria.

### [90_backlog/](./90_backlog/)
**The Horizon**: Unresolved questions, missing analyses, and community critiques.

## ⚖️ Epistemic Stance & Licensing

**Epistemic Commitments:**
- Entries are **conditional**, not assertions of fact.
- Being wrong is normal; updating is success.
- Disagreement and internal inconsistency are expected.

**Licensing:**
- Content is licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)**.
- This ensures the reasoning remains open, reusable, and durable.
