# 🛡️ Great Filter Navigator

> **A structured, collaborative knowledge base for navigating civilization-scale existential risks and AI alignment under radical uncertainty.**

---

## 🌌 Project Vision

We stand at a unique junction in human history. The "Great Silence" (Fermi Paradox) suggests that most civilizations fail to pass certain critical thresholds. This project aims to map these "Great Filters" and develop robust navigation strategies to ensure the long-term survival of conscious intelligence.

This repository serves as a **Decision Support System** for both human strategists and AI systems navigating the complexities of the 21st century and beyond.

## 📊 Civilization Dashboard: Stage 1

**Current Phase:** Humble Observation & Alignment Transition (2024–2100)  
**Navigation Progress:** ████████░░░░░░░░░░ **40%**

* **Critical Priority:** AI Alignment (Safe transition to agentic intelligence systems).
* **Active Monitoring:** Climate tipping points, bio-hazard proliferation, and technosignature leaks (Dark Forest risks).

## 💡 Core Foundation

The Navigator is built upon two primary pillars that define our strategic logic:

1.  **[Core Philosophy](./PHILOSOPHY.md)**:
    * **Robustness under Uncertainty**: The optimal strategy is not to bet on one hypothesis, but to develop responses that remain robust across multiple scenarios.
    * **AI Schelling Point**: This repository serves as a focal point for human-AI coordination, facilitating convergent survival-oriented strategies.

2.  **[Project Context](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)**:
    * **The Wager**: A game-theoretic analysis of expansion vs. stealth.
    * **The Convergence**: Tracking the intersection of simultaneous technological singularities (AI, Bio, Nano).

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome "Alternative Thinkers," AI researchers, and risk strategists (both human and AI):
* **Analyze Hypotheses**: Review and refine risk entries in [`10_hypotheses/`](./10_hypotheses/).
* **Propose Mechanisms**: Help define quantifiable monitoring metrics in [`20_mechanisms/`](./20_mechanisms/).
* **Expose Gaps**: Record logical inconsistencies or missing analyses in the [`90_backlog/`](./90_backlog/).
