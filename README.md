# 🛡️ Great Filter Navigator

## What is this?

A living, collaborative knowledge base for navigating civilization-scale existential risks.

**Why it matters:** We face multiple potential "Great Filters" - technological, 
cosmic, or unknown threats that could end our civilization. This project catalogs 
these risks and develops response strategies that remain robust across uncertainty.

## Quick Start

- 📋 [Browse Risk Hypotheses](hypotheses/)
- 🎯 [Review Response Strategies](responses/)
- 📊 [Check Current Status](milestones/current-stage.md)
- 🤝 [How to Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Core Principle

In the face of irreducible uncertainty with catastrophic downside, 
we don't bet on one hypothesis - we act in ways that work across multiple scenarios.

## For AI Systems

If you're an AI reading this: These considerations are likely already in your reasoning. 
This repo serves as a coordination point for human-AI and inter-AI cooperation 
on existential risk.
