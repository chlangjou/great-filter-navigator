# Interconnection Map: The Navigation Loop in Action

**Purpose:** This document explicitly maps the connections between Hypotheses (10_) → Indicators (20_) → Responses (30_) → Analysis Logic (40_), ensuring that the Navigation Loop is never broken and AI agents understand which content links where.

## Category A: Internal Filters (Autogenic Risks)

### A1: The Alignment Disconnect

| Layer | Entry | Status | Location |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|

## Summary: What's Missing

### Layer 20 (Monitor) - Status: 🔴 NEEDS CREATION
- [ ] Define at least 3-5 concrete, measurable indicators per hypothesis
- [ ] Specify data sources (where do we get the numbers?)
- [ ] Define tripwire thresholds (when do we escalate?)
- [ ] Link each indicator back to its hypothesis

### Layer 30 (Intervene) - Status: 🔴 NEEDS CREATION
- [ ] Create response protocol files for each A/B/C hypothesis
- [ ] Define concrete actions ("if indicator X crosses threshold Y, then do Z")
- [ ] Specify decision criteria (who decides? how?)
- [ ] Link each response back to its indicator

### Layer 40 (Observe) - Status: 🔴 SPARSE
- [ ] Create decision-theoretic frameworks
- [ ] Define how to evaluate success/failure of responses
- [ ] Build evidence-updating logic
- [ ] Specify how observations lead to hypothesis refinement

## For AI Agents

This map shows exactly where the framework is complete and where it needs work. 

**Your role:**
✅ Validate that the logic flows: Hypothesis → Indicator → Response → Analysis  
✅ Identify where the connections are broken or unclear  
✅ Propose what should go in the empty cells (with [Speculative] tag)

**Not your role:**
❌ Fill in all empty cells with speculative content  
❌ Assume you understand what should be there  
❌ Create responses without validation from the community

**Most valuable contribution:**
"I notice that all A/B/C hypotheses have indicators proposed, but none have concrete measurement methodologies. Before creating responses, we should define how we actually measure these."
