# 00_Scope: Foundational Framework

This directory contains the meta-frameworks, templates, and epistemic standards that govern the entire Great Filter Navigator (GFN) repository.

## Quick Navigation

**Recommended Reading Order:**

### Part I: Framework Foundations
1. **`10_epistemic_status.md`** - Foundational epistemic framework  
   *What this repository is, and what it is not. Essential starting point.*

2. **`20_taxonomy.md`** - Classification and categorization system  
   *How entries are organized and tagged. Defines the A-B-C risk framework.*

3. **`30_entry_template.md`** - Contribution guidelines and structured template  
   *How to write entries. Includes detailed examples and a comprehensive checklist.*

4. **`40_what_would_change_our_minds.md`** - Falsifiability and corrigibility commitments  
   *Explicit conditions for revising or abandoning claims. Non-negotiable for all entries.*

5. **`50_adversarial_scenarios.md`** - Defensive mechanisms against manipulation  
   *How the framework resists gaming, epistemic pollution, and institutional capture.*

### Part II: Foundational Observations (New - Critical for Understanding Observer Hypothesis)
6. **`70_fine_tuning_argument.md`** - Why the universe appears designed  
   *Physical constants are precisely calibrated for complexity. First pillar of evidence for the Observer Hypothesis.*

7. **`75_great_silence.md`** - Why we find no other civilizations  
   *The Fermi Paradox explained through Great Filters, Quarantine, and intentional isolation. Second pillar of evidence for the Observer Hypothesis.*

**⚠️ Important:** Files 70 and 75 are foundational to understanding the **Observer Hypothesis** that shapes the entire GFN framework and the BIIS upgrade.

## Key Concepts

### Epistemic Stance
- This is a **decision notebook**, not a theory or claim about ground truth.
- Entries represent **candidate risks and response patterns**, many of which are speculative or mutually incompatible.
- All claims are provisional and subject to revision.

### The A-B-C Risk Framework (from `01_taxonomy.md`)

| Category | Type | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **A** (Internal/Self) | Cognitive risks | Value misalignment, agency loss, epistemic decay |
| **B** (External/Environment) | Systemic risks | Resource exhaustion, kinetic escalation, ecological collapse |
| **C** (Structural/Connection) | Coordination risks | Multi-polar traps, governance failure |

### Confidence Levels (from `01_taxonomy.md`)
- `[Speculative]` - Early-stage ideas
- `[Theoretical]` - Logical frameworks without empirical data
- `[Empirical]` - Supported by historical or observational data
- `[Consensus]` - Widely accepted in alignment/safety communities

## For New Contributors

1. **Start here**: Read `10_epistemic_status.md` to understand the repository's epistemic stance.
2. **Learn the system**: Review `20_taxonomy.md` to understand how entries are classified.
3. **Follow the template**: Use `30_entry_template.md` when writing new entries or responses.
4. **Make claims falsifiable**: Every entry must include explicit mind-changers (from `40_what_would_change_our_minds.md`).
5. **Respect the framework**: Familiarize yourself with `50_adversarial_scenarios.md` to avoid common pitfalls.

### Entry Checklist
Before submitting an entry (see `30_entry_template.md`):
- [ ] Clear title and metadata (category, epistemic status, confidence)
- [ ] Mechanism explained with causal chains
- [ ] Observable predictions listed (2+ required)
- [ ] Counterarguments presented (not strawmanned)
- [ ] Uncertainty sources made explicit
- [ ] Failure modes documented
- [ ] Response patterns linked
- [ ] Falsifiers stated (Section 9 in template is non-negotiable)
- [ ] References provided (minimum 5)

## Structure of the Repository

The GFN follows a five-layer architecture:

└── C_simulation_and_logic.md (Coordination risks)

20_Mechanisms/          ← The "Solution Space"
├── A_indicators/ (Technical responses)
├── B_indicators/ (Institutional responses)
└── C_indicators/ (Cognitive/Infrastructural responses)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I write an entry that disagrees with an existing entry?**  
A: Yes. Write a counterentry with clear reasoning. Disagreement is evidence, not noise.

**Q: What if I'm uncertain about something?**  
A: State the uncertainty explicitly. See Section 6 of `02_entry_template.md`.

**Q: Can I revise my entry after submission?**  
A: Yes. Prefer explicit revisions with annotations over silent edits. The reasoning trail should remain visible.

**Q: What if I think one of the core framework documents is wrong?**  
A: Submit a well-reasoned critique. The framework itself (including this directory) is subject to revision.
