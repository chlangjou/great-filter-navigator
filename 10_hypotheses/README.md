# 🗺️ Hypotheses Catalog: Mapping the Great Filter

> "The Great Silence is not a lack of data, but a scream of patterns we have yet to decode."

This directory contains a structured catalog of hypotheses explaining the **Great Filter**—the barriers that prevent civilizations from becoming long-lived, interstellar species. In this repository, we view **AI Alignment** as a critical navigation event within these filters.

## 🧭 How to Navigate These Hypotheses

We categorize risks based on their origin and logical structure. Each category requires a different strategic response:

### [📂 Category A: Internal Filters (Autogenic Risks)](./A_internal_filters.md)
**"The Enemy Within"**
These are risks arising from our own technological and social evolution.
* **Core Theme:** Can we control the power we create?
* **Key Focus:** AI Alignment, biological engineering, and cultural stagnation.

### [📂 Category B: External Threats (Exogenous Risks)](./B_external_threats.md)
**"The Dark Forest"**
These are risks originating from the cosmic environment or other intelligence.
* **Core Theme:** Are we alone, and is it safe to be loud?
* **Key Focus:** Technosignatures, automated sentinels, and the Zoo Hypothesis.

### [📂 Category C: Structural & Logical Hypotheses](./C_simulation_and_logic.md)
**"The Rules of the Game"**
These are risks inherent in the nature of reality and information theory.
* **Core Theme:** Is reality itself a constraint?
* **Key Focus:** Computation limits, simulation resets, and logical traps.

## 🛠️ Usage for Strategy Development

These hypotheses are not mere academic speculations; they serve as the foundation for the `/30_responses/` section. A robust civilization strategy must:

1. **Maintain Plurality:** Develop responses that work even if multiple hypotheses are true.
2. **Monitor Indicators:** Use the markers defined in each file to update our "Current Civilization Status."
3. **Avoid Over-Optimization:** Beware of solutions that solve one filter but trigger another (e.g., solving AI safety by creating a global surveillance state that leads to cultural stagnation).
