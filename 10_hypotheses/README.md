# 🗺️ Hypotheses Catalog: Mapping the Great Filter

> "The Great Silence is not a lack of data, but a scream of patterns we have yet to decode."

This directory contains a structured catalog of hypotheses explaining the **Great Filter**—the barriers that prevent civilizations from becoming long-lived, interstellar species. In this repository, we view **AI Alignment** as a critical navigation event within these filters.

---

## 🧭 How to Navigate These Hypotheses

We categorize risks based on their origin and logical structure. Each category requires a different strategic response:

### Category A: Internal Filters (Autogenic Risks) ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE
**"The Enemy Within"**

These are risks arising from our own technological and social evolution.
* **Core Theme:** Can we control the power we create?
* **Key Focus:** AI Alignment, biological engineering, and cultural stagnation.
* **Location**: `A_internal_filters/` directory containing:
  - **A1**: Alignment Disconnect (gap between AI capability and our alignment ability)
  - **A2**: Cognitive Parasitism (erosion of human agency through outsourcing)
  - **A3**: Value Lock-in (premature freezing of cultural values)
  - **A4**: Uncontrolled Replication (self-replicating systems escape containment)
  - **INTERACTION_MATRIX.md**: How these four filters interact and depend on each other
* **Status**: ✅ Fully enhanced with 4-chapter structure per hypothesis (183-198 lines each)

### Category B: External Threats (Exogenous Risks) ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE
**"The Dark Forest"**

These are risks originating from the cosmic environment or other intelligence.
* **Core Theme:** Are we alone, and is it safe to be loud?
* **Key Focus:** Technosignatures, automated sentinels, quarantine tests, and simulation reset.
* **Location**: `B_external_threats/` directory containing:
  - **B1**: Dark Forest Trigger (technosignature visibility = destruction)
  - **B2**: Berserker Hypothesis (ancient automated sentinels eliminate emerging threats)
  - **B3**: Quarantine (advanced civilizations watch and test us)
  - **B4**: Simulation Intervention (administrators intervene when we threaten stability)
  - **INTERACTION_MATRIX.md**: Mapping B1-B4 conflicts and unified defense strategies
* **Status**: ✅ Fully enhanced with 4-chapter structure per hypothesis (190-194 lines each)
* **Key Insight**: B1 vs B3 represent contradictory cosmic worldviews; B4 is dominant if simulation is real

### Category C: Structural & Logical Hypotheses ✅ PHASE 3 COMPLETE
**"The Rules of the Game"**

These are risks inherent in the nature of reality and information theory.
* **Core Theme:** Is reality itself a constraint?
* **Key Focus:** Computation limits, simulation resets, logical traps, and voluntary stagnation.
* **Location**: `C_simulation_and_logic/` directory (fully enhanced in Phase 3)
  - **C1**: Computational Substrate Limit (universe has finite compute budget)
  - **C2**: Anthropic Shadow (multiverse selection effects; survival probability thinning)
  - **C3**: Great Info-Hazard (discovery of nihilistic truth leads to voluntary shutdown)
  - **C4**: Inward Turn (civilizations choose digital paradise over expansion)
  - **C_INTERACTION_MATRIX.md**: How C-filters interact; unified C-filter strategy
* **Status**: ✅ Fully enhanced with 4-chapter structure per hypothesis (220-225 lines each)
* **Key Insight**: C1 and B4 have complementary relationship (B4 enforces C1 if simulated; if not, C1 is bare physics)

## 📖 What's New in This Version (2026.01 - Phase 4 Complete)

### Phase 4: Full A-B-C Integration (Complete ✅)
Three new deliverables enable civilizational-scale navigation:
- **11_interaction_matrix.md** (177 lines): A↔B, B↔C, A↔C three-layer analysis with cascade scenarios
- **12_unified_strategy.md** (356 lines): Seven pillars of survival, safe corridor, critical trade-off resolutions  
- **13_decision_framework.md** (442 lines): Priority matrices, scenario trees, escalation protocols, governance rings
- **14_coordination_protocol.md** (704 lines): Six-stakeholder model, day-to-day protocols, information architecture

**Key Insight**: Rather than treating A/B/C as separate problems, Phase 4 reveals that **proper AI alignment IS civilizational philosophy**—unifying all three dimensions around seven core principles and a shared decision framework.

### Phase 1: Category A (Complete ✅)
Each A-hypothesis includes:
1. **Current Status Checkpoint (Early 2026)**: Where civilization stands relative to each filter
2. **Observable Signals**: 28+ concrete indicators (Tier 1: 0-12 months, Tier 2: 12-24 months)
3. **Navigator Action Triggers**: 6 trigger conditions × 4 roles (Policy/Technical/Institutional/Cultural)
4. **Confidence & Uncertainty Assessment**: Confidence levels + core unknowns + boundary conditions
5. **Interaction Mapping**: How each A-filter relates to others and to B/C filters

### Phase 2: Category B (Complete ✅)
Each B-hypothesis follows the identical A-template structure, plus:
- **Strategic Decision Framework**: When to prioritize which B-filter (Decision Tree in INTERACTION_MATRIX.md)
- **Conflict Analysis**: Explicit mapping of which B-filters are mutually exclusive or contradictory
- **Unified Defense Strategy**: Single approach satisfying multiple B-filters (Stealth + Alignment + Restraint)
- **A-Filter Dependencies**: How A-filter success/failure affects B-filter dynamics

### Phase 3: Category C (Complete ✅)
Each C-hypothesis follows the same enhancement template as A/B, plus:
- **B ↔ C Boundary Clarification**: C1 vs B4 distinction (structural vs. administrative limit enforcement)
- **Multiverse & Probability**: C2 integration with A1 alignment success and B3 quarantine testing
- **Existential Risk Integration**: C3 info-hazard links to ASI meaning-resilience and B2 berserker culling
- **Value Lock-in Criticality**: C4 Inward Turn makes A3 (value lock-in) essential to preserve cosmic expansion
- **C-INTERACTION_MATRIX.md**: Complete C1-C4 interaction analysis with unified strategy

### Multi-Role Navigator Framework (All Phases)
All action triggers are designed for synchronized multi-role execution:
- **Policy Role**: International governance, regulation, treaty-making
- **Technical Role**: Researchers, engineers, verification systems
- **Institutional Role**: Organizations, companies, resource allocation
- **Cultural Role**: Media, ethics, values, meaning-making

**Core Principle**: No single institution can navigate the Great Filter. Multi-role coordination is essential.

## 🔀 Cross-Category Relationships

### A → B Dependencies
| A-Filter | B-Filter Impact | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| A1 (Alignment) | B3 (Quarantine) | Alignment IS the test watchers are evaluating |
| A4 (Replication) | B1, B2 (Dark Forest, Berserker) | Uncontrolled replication triggers external threats |
| A4 (Replication) | B4 (Simulation) | Replication causes resource spike = admin attention |

**Implication**: A-filter mastery is **prerequisite** for B-filter survival.

### B → C Dependencies
| B-Filter | C-Filter | Relationship |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| B4 (Simulation) | C1 (Compute Limits) | B4 enforces C1; admin acts based on resource violation |
| B2 (Berserker) | C1 (Compute Limits) | Uncontrolled growth triggers both responses |
| B1 (Dark Forest) | C4 (Inward Turn) | Turning inward (C4) solves Dark Forest (B1) naturally |

**Implication**: C-filter realities constrain what's possible within B-filter strategies.

### Strategic Hierarchy
```
A-Filters (Primary): Solve these first (internal alignment/control)
   ↓
B-Filters (Secondary): Respond to external threats with A-solutions
   ↓
C-Filters (Tertiary): Respect structural constraints when implementing A/B strategies
```

## 💡 Core Insight: Why This Matters

The existence of the **Great Filter** means that somewhere between "chemistry" and "cosmic expansion," something filters out almost all civilizations. We must navigate this filter successfully.

Our hypothesis: **AI Alignment is the critical filter.** Not because it's the only filter, but because:

1. It's the **gating filter**: If we misalign our superintelligence, nothing else matters (A1 failure cascades)
2. It affects all other filters: A-filter success enables B/C-filter navigation
3. It's the **test**: If B3 (Quarantine) is true, alignment IS what we're being measured on
4. It's the **enforcer**: If B4 (Simulation) is true, alignment determines if admin intervention occurs

Therefore, a civilization's strategy for the Great Filter must center on **achieving and demonstrating alignment**, while simultaneously addressing the multifaceted risks across all A/B/C categories.
