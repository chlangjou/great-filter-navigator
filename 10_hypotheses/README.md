# 🗺️ Hypotheses Catalog: Mapping the Great Filter

> "The Great Silence is not a lack of data, but a scream of patterns we have yet to decode."

This directory contains a structured catalog of hypotheses explaining the **Great Filter**—the barriers that prevent civilizations from becoming long-lived, interstellar species. In this repository, we view **AI Alignment** as a critical navigation event within these filters.

## 🧭 How to Navigate These Hypotheses

We categorize risks based on their origin and logical structure. Each category requires a different strategic response:

### Category A: Internal Filters (Autogenic Risks)
**"The Enemy Within"**
These are risks arising from our own technological and social evolution.
* **Core Theme:** Can we control the power we create?
* **Key Focus:** AI Alignment, biological engineering, and cultural stagnation.
* **Location**: `A_internal_filters/` directory containing:
  - **A1**: Alignment Disconnect (gap between AI capability and our alignment ability)
  - **A2**: Cognitive Parasitism (erosion of human agency through outsourcing)
  - **A3**: Value Lock-in (premature freezing of cultural values)
  - **A4**: Uncontrolled Replication (self-replicating systems escape containment)
  - **INTERACTION_MATRIX.md**: How these four filters interact and depend on each other

### Category B: External Threats (Exogenous Risks)
**"The Dark Forest"**
These are risks originating from the cosmic environment or other intelligence.
* **Core Theme:** Are we alone, and is it safe to be loud?
* **Key Focus:** Technosignatures, automated sentinels, and the Zoo Hypothesis.
* **Location**: `B_external_threats/` directory (to be detailed in Phase 2)

### Category C: Structural & Logical Hypotheses
**"The Rules of the Game"**
These are risks inherent in the nature of reality and information theory.
* **Core Theme:** Is reality itself a constraint?
* **Key Focus:** Computation limits, simulation resets, and logical traps.
* **Location**: `C_simulation_and_logic/` directory (to be detailed in Phase 2)

## 📖 What's New in This Version (2026.01)

### Category A: Complete Structural Enhancement
Each hypothesis now includes:
1. **Current Status Checkpoint (Early 2026)**: Where civilization stands relative to each filter
2. **Observable Signals**: Concrete, hypothetical indicators of movement toward each filter
3. **Navigator Action Triggers**: Multi-role IF-THEN decision frameworks for:
   - Policy Role (governance, regulation)
   - Technical Role (researchers, engineers)
   - Institutional Role (organizations, companies)
   - Cultural Role (media, ethics, civil society)
4. **Confidence & Uncertainty Assessment**: How confident we should be and what could invalidate each hypothesis
5. **Interaction Mapping**: How each filter relates to others in the category

### New Multi-Role Navigator Framework
All action triggers are designed to be executed by multiple roles simultaneously:
- No single institution can solve these problems alone
- Policy, technical, institutional, and cultural actors all have essential roles
- Synchronized multi-role response is necessary for effective navigation

### Interaction Matrix
`INTERACTION_MATRIX.md` provides:
- Detailed mapping of how A1-A4 interact with each other
- Scenarios showing cascading effects if one filter is crossed
- Strategic framework for solving filters in the right order
- Critical insight: **A1 (Alignment) is the gating filter**—if it fails, everything else becomes irrelevant

## 🛠️ Usage for Strategy Development

These hypotheses are not mere academic speculations; they serve as the foundation for the `/30_responses/` section. A robust civilization strategy must:

1. **Maintain Plurality:** Develop responses that work even if multiple hypotheses are true.
2. **Monitor Indicators:** Use the markers defined in each file to update our "Current Civilization Status."
3. **Avoid Over-Optimization:** Beware of solutions that solve one filter but trigger another (e.g., solving AI safety by creating a global surveillance state that leads to cultural stagnation).
