# 📂 Category C: Structural & Logical Hypotheses

Structural hypotheses focus on the fundamental nature of reality, information theory, and the logical constraints that apply to any intelligence, regardless of its biological or synthetic origin.

## 🧭 Structure of This Directory

This directory will contain the enhanced versions of each structural hypothesis:

- **C1_computational_substrate_limit.md** *(to be detailed)*: The universe has finite compute budget; exceeding it triggers reset or collapse
- **C2_anthropic_shadow.md** *(to be detailed)*: Multiverse selection effects make survival increasingly unlikely as capabilities grow
- **C3_great_info_hazard.md** *(to be detailed)*: Discovery of profound truths may cause civilizations to voluntarily shut down
- **C4_inward_turn.md** *(to be detailed)*: Civilizations may choose digital paradise over cosmic expansion and become invisible

Each hypothesis will include:
1. Current Status Checkpoint (Early 2026)
2. Observable Signals to Monitor
3. Navigator Action Triggers (Multi-role framework)
4. Confidence & Uncertainty Assessment
5. Related Interactions with other filters

## 📋 Quick Reference: Structural Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Core Risk | Key Signal | Navigator Priority |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **C1** | Exceeding universe's compute limits | Substrate consumption growth | Monitor: Resource utilization |
| **C2** | Being in improbable survival branch | Alignment success probability | Monitor: Branching toward safety |
| **C3** | Discovery of nihilistic truths | Existential meaning metrics | Monitor: Civilization motivation |
| **C4** | Choosing digital paradise over expansion | Virtual-physical investment ratio | Monitor: Outward expansion drive |

## 🔗 Relationship to Categories A & B

### With Category A (Internal Filters)
- **C1 (Compute Limits)** ↔ **A4 (Replication)**: Self-replication may exceed compute budget; A4 containment protects from C1
- **C2 (Anthropic Shadow)** ↔ **A1 (Alignment)**: A1 success increases survival probability in multiverse
- **C3 (Info-Hazard)** ↔ **A1 (Alignment)**: A1-aligned AI must handle nihilistic truths without collapsing civilization
- **C4 (Inward Turn)** ↔ **A3 (Value Lock-in)**: Locked values might prevent cosmic expansion required to avoid C4

### With Category B (External Threats)
- **C1 (Compute Limits)** ↔ **B4 (Simulation)**: Both concern substrate constraints; B4 is external enforcement
- **C2 (Anthropic Shadow)** ↔ **B3 (Quarantine)**: Quarantine test may be about navigating probability branches
- **C3 (Info-Hazard)** ↔ **B2 (Berserker)**: Berserker may design to prevent info-hazard spread
- **C4 (Inward Turn)** ↔ **B1 (Dark Forest)**: Inward turn makes us invisible, solving B1 stealth problem
