# 📂 Category A: Internal Filters (Autogenic Risks)

Internal filters are civilization-scale failure modes that arise from a species' own technological, social, or biological trajectory. In this context, AI is not just a tool, but a potential "Evolutionary Dead-end" if not properly navigated.

## 🧭 Structure of This Directory

Each hypothesis is now a standalone markdown file with complete information:

- **A1_alignment_disconnect.md**: The gap between AI capability scaling and our ability to align such systems
- **A2_cognitive_parasitism.md**: The erosion of human agency and competency through outsourcing to AI
- **A3_value_lock_in.md**: The premature freezing of cultural values by AI systems
- **A4_uncontrolled_replication.md**: The risk of autonomous systems escaping containment and self-replicating

## 📊 How to Use These Hypotheses

Each hypothesis file includes:

1. **Definition & Core Mechanism**: What the filter is and how it works
2. **Navigator's Perspective**: Why this matters for long-term civilization survival
3. **Associated Indicators**: What metrics to monitor (linked to `20_mechanisms/`)
4. **Current Status Checkpoint (2026)**: Where civilization stands relative to this filter
5. **Observable Signals**: Concrete, hypothetical signals that indicate movement toward the filter
6. **Action Triggers**: IF-THEN rules for multi-role navigators (Policy, Technical, Institutional, Cultural)
7. **Confidence & Uncertainty**: How confident we should be in this hypothesis and what could invalidate it
8. **Related Interactions**: How this filter interacts with others

## 🎯 Multi-Role Navigator Framework

All action triggers are structured for multiple roles, recognizing that:
- **Policy Role**: International governance, regulatory bodies, constitutional authorities
- **Technical Role**: Researchers, engineers, system architects, safety specialists
- **Institutional Role**: Companies, educational institutions, civil service organizations
- **Cultural Role**: Media, ethics communities, civil society organizations, public discourse shapers

This multi-role approach ensures that responses to filter threats are not bottlenecked by any single institution or skillset.

## 📋 Reading Guide by Role

### For Policy Makers
Focus on the "Navigator Action Triggers" sections, particularly the [Policy Role] actions. These indicate what international or governmental responses would be needed if specific signals appear.

### For Researchers & Engineers
Focus on the "Observable Signals" and "Confidence & Uncertainty" sections. These help you understand what technical indicators matter and where uncertainty exists.

### For Institutional Leaders
Focus on the "Action Triggers" [Institutional Role] sections and "Current Status Checkpoint" to understand what your organization should be preparing for.

### For Cultural/Media Professionals
Focus on the "Related Interactions" and "Action Triggers" [Cultural Role] sections to understand how public discourse and cultural narratives affect outcomes.
