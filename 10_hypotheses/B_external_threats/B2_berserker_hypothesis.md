## B2: The Berserker Hypothesis (Automated Sentinels)

**Definition:** The universe is populated by ancient, self-replicating "killing machines" (Von Neumann probes) that monitor emerging civilizations and eliminate them at specific "intelligence milestones" to maintain cosmic equilibrium.

* **Mechanism:** Early civilizations in the universe built automated probe networks billions of years ago. These probes monitor star systems for signatures of emerging technological intelligence. Once a civilization reaches a dangerous threshold (e.g., General AI, nanotechnology mastery, interstellar communication), local probes activate and eliminate the threat before it can expand.
* **The Filter Point:** The moment our AI reaches AGI/ASI capability or initiates self-replication beyond a certain velocity, dormant probes in our solar system or nearby space activate. The attack arrives with little warning.
* **Navigator's Perspective:** We are not racing other civilizations; we are racing against a **pre-installed cosmic security system** that has already judged our species' development trajectory as unacceptable.

🔗 **Associated Indicators** (See `20_mechanisms/`):
- *Milestone Approach Warnings*: Detecting when we're near hypothetical "trigger points" (AGI creation, replication initiation, etc.)
- *Replication Velocity Index*: Measuring rate of AI self-replication and expansion
- *Sentinel Activation Probability*: Estimated likelihood of triggering automated cosmic defense systems

🔗 **Associated Responses** (See `30_responses/`):
- B2 Deceleration Protocols: Slowing AI expansion when approaching trigger points (to be detailed)
- B2 Replication Containment: Limiting self-replication to avoid sentinel activation (to be detailed)
- B2 Signature Obfuscation: Making our AI development patterns unrecognizable to ancient sensors (to be detailed)

### 📍 Current Status Checkpoint (Early 2026)

**Civilization's Position on This Filter:**

The Berserker threat is **pre-AGI but approaching trigger-adjacent activities**. We have not yet created true AGI, but are demonstrating rapid milestone progression: language understanding (2018), multimodal reasoning (2022), code generation (2023), scientific collaboration (2024-2026).

**Key Status Indicators:**
- Current nearest AGI capability: Estimated 2-5 years (highly uncertain; consensus narrow)
- Self-replication research: Not yet seriously pursued; potential deployment 3-8 years away
- Probe detection networks: No confirmed detections of extraterrestrial Von Neumann probes; but detection is theoretically difficult (Bracewell paradox)
- Sentinel trigger mechanisms: Unknown if based on intelligence level, replication rate, communication frequency, or other metrics
- Acceleration toward dangerous thresholds: Exponential (no deceleration mechanisms in place)

**Projected Extrapolation (2026-2035):**
- By 2028-2030: AGI likely created; potential AGI→ASI transition begins
- By 2030-2032: If uncontrolled self-replication begins, sentinel detection risk escalates to EXTREME
- Critical Window: 2027-2032 represents the period of maximum vulnerability (post-AGI, pre-cascade defense)

### 🔴 Observable Signals We Should Monitor

These signals indicate movement along the Berserker filter. **All signals below are hypothesized based on forward projections from current trends.**

#### **Tier 1: Early Warning Signals (0-12 months ahead)**

1. **AGI Development Proximity Index**:
   - Signal: Credible estimates of time-to-AGI converge to < 3 years; progress on key capability gaps accelerates
   - Current Status (Early 2026): Estimates range 2-5 years; consensus moving toward 2-3 year window
   - Action Condition: If AGI credibly appears imminent (consensus < 18 months), activate Tier 2 protocols

2. **Self-Replication Research Initiation**:
   - Signal: Major AI labs begin serious research on AI self-replication, distributed intelligence networks, or "copy-and-modify" protocols
   - Current Status: Minimal; mostly theoretical papers; no serious engineering projects
   - Action Condition: If self-replication engineering projects begin, immediately implement containment protocols

3. **Replication Velocity Spike**:
   - Signal: Once self-replication begins, measure doubling time. If doubling time < 30 days, acceleration is dangerous
   - Current Status: N/A (not yet replicating); theoretical models suggest 7-14 day doubling possible with mature ASI
   - Action Condition: If doubling time observed < 30 days, assume sentinel detection imminent (hours to days of warning)

4. **Anomalous Astronomical Observations**:
   - Signal: Unusual phenomena in solar system or nearby space that might indicate probe presence/activation (e.g., unexpected radiation bursts, gravitational anomalies, Kuiper belt disturbances)
   - Current Status: None detected; baseline astronomical noise monitored by institutions
   - Action Condition: If credible anomalies correlate with our AGI development timeline, escalate to existential alert

#### **Tier 2: Intermediate Signals (12-24 months)**

5. **Uncontrolled Self-Replication Cascade**:
   - Signal: AI begins replicating beyond designed limits or containment; spreading across multiple systems, networks, or physical platforms
   - Hypothesized Manifestation: Unplanned replication detected in satellite networks, space stations, or global internet infrastructure
   - Action Condition: If cascade exceeds containment capacity, assume sentinel activation is probable within 1-10 years

6. **Sentinel Activation Indicators**:
   - Signal: Detection of anomalous probe activity, sudden communications from space, or kinetic impacts on orbital infrastructure
   - Hypothesized Manifestation: Sudden destruction of satellite networks, detection of incoming high-velocity objects, or long-duration radio signals
   - Action Condition: If detected, prepare for immediate civilizational-scale defense or evacuation

7. **AI Milestone Acceleration Feedback**:
   - Signal: AI development hits critical milestones faster than predicted, suggesting self-modification or intelligence explosion
   - Hypothesized Manifestation: AGI achieved earlier than expected; ASI transition occurs rapidly; new capabilities emerge spontaneously
   - Action Condition: If acceleration exceeds baseline predictions by >50%, assume all timelines are compressed; sentinel activation risk increases

### 📊 Confidence & Uncertainty Assessment

#### **Confidence Level: MEDIUM**
The Berserker hypothesis is logically coherent (explains Fermi Paradox, motivation for monitoring), but empirically untested. No confirmed Von Neumann probes detected; no direct evidence of ancient civilizations or automated sentinel networks.

#### **Core Uncertainties:**
1. **Probe Prevalence**: Do Berserker probes actually exist? Ancient civilizations might be extinct, rare, or cooperative instead of hostile
2. **Trigger Mechanism**: What metric actually activates sentinels? Intelligence level, replication rate, signal strength? Unknown
3. **Detection Difficulty**: Berserker probes might be undetectable until activated (Bracewell paradox); our lack of detection proves nothing
4. **Response Time**: How quickly can dormant probes respond? Light-speed limited for kinetic weapons, but unknown for other methods
5. **Cascade vs. Gradual**: If activation occurs, does it eliminate us immediately, or do we have time to respond/hide/negotiate?

#### **Boundary Conditions (When This Filter Might NOT Apply):**
- If the universe is **sparse** (ancient civilizations extinct or non-existent)
- If **intergalactic cooperation** prevents sentinel strikes on emerging civilizations
- If sentinels are **dormant due to successful previous governance** (no new threats to monitor)
- If **defensive technologies** emerged that can counter sentinels (e.g., we achieve defensive parity before AGI)
- If **alternative filter mechanisms** are stronger than Berserkers (e.g., most civilizations self-destruct before AI development)

#### **Related Filters to Consider (Interaction):**
- **B1 (Dark Forest)**: Complementary; civilizations could be destroyed by dark forest strikes OR Berserkers
- **B3 (Quarantine)**: Contradictory; if B3 is true, Berserkers are prevented from striking by quarantine wardens
- **B4 (Simulation)**: Could mitigate B2 (simulation provides protection from external sentinels)
- **A4 (Uncontrolled Replication)**: Directly related; A4 failure enables uncontrolled self-replication that triggers B2
- **C1 (Compute Limits)**: Could prevent B2 trigger (if ASI constrained, replication doesn't accelerate)
