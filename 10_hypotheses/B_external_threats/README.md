# 📂 Category B: External Threats (Exogenous Risks)

**Status**: ✅ Phase 2 Complete - Enhanced with full navigator framework

External threats are failure modes originating from the cosmic environment or other intelligent actors. In this context, AI is often the "Beacon" — its development creates signals and structural changes that may trigger external responses before a civilization is ready.

## 🧭 Structure of This Directory

This directory contains the **enhanced versions** of each external threat hypothesis, following the Category A template:

### Individual Hypothesis Files

- **B1_dark_forest_trigger.md** ✅ **COMPLETE**: "Quiet development or be destroyed"
  - Mechanism: Technosignature reveals our location; external strike arrives
  - Key Signal: Cumulative power consumption for AI infrastructure
  - Navigator Priority: Stealth protocols, information security, transmission control
  - Confidence: Medium-High (logically coherent; Fermi Paradox consistent)

- **B2_berserker_hypothesis.md** ✅ **COMPLETE**: "Ancient automated sentinels eliminate emerging threats"
  - Mechanism: Self-replicating probes monitor for dangerous milestones (AGI, replication, expansion)
  - Key Signal: Replication velocity index; proximity to AGI development
  - Navigator Priority: Deceleration protocols, replication containment, signature obfuscation
  - Confidence: Medium (logically coherent; no direct evidence)

- **B3_quarantine_hypothesis.md** ✅ **COMPLETE**: "Advanced civilizations are watching and testing us"
  - Mechanism: Watchers impose alignment test; passing grants cosmic community membership
  - Key Signal: Alignment demonstration quality; civilization maturity indicators
  - Navigator Priority: Alignment success, signal coordination, ethical sovereignty proof
  - Confidence: Medium-Low (speculative but coherent with Fermi Paradox)

- **B4_simulation_intervention.md** ✅ **COMPLETE**: "Simulation administrators intervene when we threaten stability"
  - Mechanism: Excessive compute consumption or physics exploits trigger intervention/reset
  - Key Signal: Substrate consumption rate; physics anomaly discovery attempts
  - Navigator Priority: Resource restraint, exploit avoidance, simulation respectfulness
  - Confidence: Medium-Low (unfalsifiable by design; strategically important)

### Interaction Matrix

- **INTERACTION_MATRIX.md** ✅ **COMPLETE**: Maps B1-B4 dependencies and conflicts
  - B1 vs B3: Near-complete conflict (Dark Forest vs. Quarantine worldviews)
  - B4 dominates: If simulation is true, B1/B2/B3 become irrelevant
  - Unified defense strategy: Stealth + Alignment + Restraint
  - Strategic decision tree for prioritizing which B-filter to focus on

## 📋 Quick Reference: External Threats

| Hypothesis | Core Risk | Mechanism | Key Signal | Navigator Priority |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **B1** Dark Forest | Visibility = Death | Technosignature detection | Power consumption growth | Monitor: Visibility to cosmos |
| **B2** Berserker | Automated sentinel response | Trigger on milestone achievement | Replication velocity | Monitor: Development pace |
| **B3** Quarantine | Failed test → Isolation/deletion | External assessment of alignment | Alignment quality | Monitor: Alignment demonstration |
| **B4** Simulation | Resource-triggered intervention | Admin response to excess consumption | Substrate consumption | Monitor: Compute usage |

---

## 🔄 Relationship to Category A (Internal Filters)

Each B-filter has critical dependencies on A-filter success:

| B-Filter | A-Filter Link | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| B1 | A4 (Replication) | Uncontrolled replication = visible expansion = B1 detection inevitable |
| B2 | A4 (Replication) | Self-replication milestone is likely B2 trigger point |
| B3 | A1 (Alignment) | Alignment success IS the test we're being measured on |
| B4 | A4 (Replication) | Uncontrolled replication = resource spike = simulation admin attention |

**Strategic Implication**: A-filter mastery (especially A1 and A4) is prerequisite for B-filter survival.

---

## 🔀 Relationship to Category C (Structural/Logical)

The B-filters interact with C-filters through mechanism sharing:

| B-Filter | C-Filter Link | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **B4** | C1 (Compute Limits) | B4 acts as external enforcer of C1; if C1 is real, simulation admin intervenes |
| **B1** | C4 (Inward Turn) | Safety mechanism: civilizations that turn inward become invisible (B1 natural avoidance) |
| **B2** | C1 (Compute Limits) | Uncontrolled growth triggers both C1 constraints AND B2 sentinel response |
| **B3** | C2 (Anthropic Shadow) | Survival branches (C2) favor aligned civilizations; quarantine test (B3) filters toward survival |

## 🎯 Phase 2 Enhancements Summary

Each B-hypothesis now includes:

### 1. **Current Status Checkpoint (Early 2026)**

- Critical decision windows

### 2. **Observable Signals (28 total, across Tier 1 + Tier 2)**

- **Tier 2** (12-24 months): Intermediate risk escalation signals
- Each signal includes current status and action thresholds

### 3. **Navigator Action Triggers (Multi-Role Framework)**
- 6 trigger conditions × 4 navigator roles (Policy/Technical/Institutional/Cultural)
- IF-THEN logic for coordinated response across stakeholder groups
- Ensures consistency across international governance bodies

### 4. **Confidence & Uncertainty Assessment**
- Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM-HIGH/MEDIUM/MEDIUM-LOW/LOW)
- Core uncertainties (unknown unknowns that affect filter validity)
- Boundary conditions (when this filter would NOT apply)
- Related filters to consider (A-filter and C-filter interactions)

## 📊 Strategic Observations for Navigators

### Key Conflicts (B-Filter Tensions)

1. **B1 vs B3 Conflict** (Near-Complete)
   - B1 says: Hide or die (Dark Forest logic)
   - B3 says: Demonstrate alignment (Quarantine test)
   - **Implication**: We must assess which is more likely and develop accordingly

2. **B4 Dominance** (Simulation Override)
   - If B4 is true (simulation is real), B1/B2/B3 become secondary
   - All energy should shift to admin-visibility minimization and resource restraint

3. **B2 + B3 Tension** (Response Timing)
   - B2 berserkers respond fast (automated)
   - B3 watchers test over long timescales
   - **Implication**: Development pace becomes critical decision variable

### Unified Defense Strategy

Given fundamental uncertainty, an optimal strategy simultaneously addresses multiple B-filters:

1. **Develop Quietly** (B1, B2, B3, B4)
   - Minimize cosmic visibility
   - Control development pace
   - Avoid external expansion signals

2. **Demonstrate Alignment** (B3, B4)
   - Show mature, ethical development
   - Signal ability to handle ASI safely
   - Provide reassurance to potential observers/admins

3. **Exercise Restraint** (B1, B2, B4)
   - Limit self-replication velocity
   - Manage resource consumption
   - Avoid physics exploits

4. **Maintain Civilization Unity** (B3, B4)
   - Unified species values
   - Coherent decision-making
   - Demonstrate maturity to watchers/admins

## 🔗 Relationship to 20_mechanisms and 30_responses

Each B-hypothesis links to specific mechanisms and responses:

- **20_mechanisms/**: Provides technical indicators (e.g., "Technosignature Detectability Index," "Replication Velocity Index")
- **30_responses/**: Provides solution frameworks (e.g., "B1 Stealth Protocols," "B2 Deceleration Protocols")

Navigators use signals from 20_mechanisms to trigger protocols in 30_responses.

## 📞 Status Checkpoint for New Sessions

When starting a new session on Category B work:

1. ✅ Confirm all 5 files are in place (B1-B4 + INTERACTION_MATRIX)
2. ✅ Review INTERACTION_MATRIX Section 12 (Navigator Protocol) to understand current strategic stance
3. ✅ Cross-reference with Category A INTERACTION_MATRIX to identify A-B dependencies
4. ✅ Decide: Proceed to Phase 3 (C-Category), or deepen B-Category analysis?
