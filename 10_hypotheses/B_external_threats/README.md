# 📂 Category B: External Threats (Exogenous Risks)

External threats are failure modes originating from the cosmic environment or other intelligent actors. In this context, AI is often the "Beacon" — its development creates signals and structural changes that may trigger external responses before a civilization is ready.

## 🧭 Structure of This Directory

This directory will contain the enhanced versions of each external threat hypothesis:

- **B1_dark_forest_trigger.md** *(to be detailed)*: Based on "Dark Forest" theory, any civilization that reveals its location is destroyed
- **B2_berserker_hypothesis.md** *(to be detailed)*: The universe may be populated by ancient, self-replicating "killing machines"
- **B3_quarantine_hypothesis.md** *(to be detailed)*: Advanced civilizations may be watching and testing us
- **B4_simulation_intervention.md** *(to be detailed)*: Simulation administrators may intervene when our AI threatens stability

Each hypothesis will include:
1. Current Status Checkpoint (Early 2026)
2. Observable Signals to Monitor
3. Navigator Action Triggers (Multi-role framework)
4. Confidence & Uncertainty Assessment
5. Related Interactions with other filters

## 📋 Quick Reference: External Threats

| Hypothesis | Core Risk | Key Signal | Navigator Priority |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **B1** | Revealing our location | Technosignature growth | Monitor: Visibility to cosmos |
| **B2** | Ancient automated defenses | AI milestone achievements | Monitor: Development pace |
| **B3** | Failed civilizational test | AI alignment demonstration | Monitor: Alignment quality |
| **B4** | Simulation resource limits | Computational efficiency | Monitor: Compute usage |

## 🔄 Relationship to Category A (Internal Filters)

- **B1 (Dark Forest)** ↔ **A4 (Replication)**: Both concern visibility and expansion; A4 solutions may violate B1 stealth requirements
- **B2 (Berserker)** ↔ **A1 (Alignment)**: Alignment failure may trigger B2 response; B2 response may require A1 success
- **B3 (Quarantine)** ↔ **A1 (Alignment)**: The quarantine may specifically test A1; B3 passing may require A1 success
- **B4 (Simulation)** ↔ **C1 (Compute Limits)**: Both concern substrate constraints; B4 is external enforcement of C1
