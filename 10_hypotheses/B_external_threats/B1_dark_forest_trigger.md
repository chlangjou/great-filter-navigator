## B1: The Dark Forest Trigger (Broadcast Risk)

**Definition:** Based on the "Dark Forest" theory, any civilization that reveals its technosignature through visible infrastructure (especially power-intensive AI development) risks immediate destruction by more advanced cosmic actors who use invisibility and preemptive strikes as survival strategy.

* **Mechanism:** To power an AGI or ASI, a civilization must build massive compute infrastructure (Dyson Swarms, megastructures, or dense power grids). These produce anomalous infrared, electromagnetic, and neutrino signatures detectable across light-years. These signatures broadcast: "A potentially dangerous new intelligence is emerging."
* **The Filter Point:** An automated or deliberate "strike" arrives from a more advanced civilization as soon as our technosignature crosses a certain threshold of detectability and "unavoidable threat."
* **Navigator's Perspective:** Alignment isn't just internal safety; it's **Cosmic Information Security**. If our AI is not "quiet," it is not aligned with our species' long-term survival. The question becomes: can we develop superintelligence *quietly*?

🔗 **Associated Indicators** (See `20_mechanisms/`):
- *Technosignature Detectability*: Measuring how visible our AI infrastructure is to external observers
- *Anomaly Detection Threshold*: What magnitude of infrared/EM signature would alert cosmic actors
- *Radio Silence Compliance*: Monitoring whether AI development maintains information security posture

### 📍 Current Status Checkpoint (Early 2026)

**Civilization's Position on This Filter:**

The Dark Forest threat is currently **dormant but activating**. We have begun large-scale AI development but have not yet triggered planetary-scale technosignature anomalies. The critical transition period is NOW: 2026-2035.

**Key Status Indicators:**
- Current global computational power dedicated to AI: ~5-8 exaflops; consumed power: ~100-200 GW (rising exponentially)
- Cumulative infrared and electromagnetic emissions from data centers: **Not yet at "cosmic attention" threshold** (estimated: 5-10 years away at current trajectory)
- No evidence of prior alien strikes on visible civilizations (which supports Dark Forest theory: they haven't revealed themselves)
- Scientific transmissions and astronomical surveys continue at low intensity (radio telescopes, SETI transmissions remain "low-power" by cosmic standards)
- Commercial and military AI development races have begun; coordination on stealth protocols is **minimal to non-existent**

**Projected Extrapolation (2026-2050):**
- By 2030: If ASI development accelerates, compute demands could reach terawatt-scale power consumption, generating observable infrared anomalies
- By 2035: Full-scale Dyson sphere or megastructure development (if attempted) becomes detectable across ~100+ light-years
- Critical Decision Point (2028-2032): Whether humanity collectively enforces "stealth-first" AI development protocols or prioritizes capability growth

### 🔴 Observable Signals We Should Monitor

These signals indicate movement along the Dark Forest filter. **All signals below are hypothesized based on forward projections from current trends.**

#### **Tier 1: Early Warning Signals (0-12 months ahead)**

1. **Technosignature Expansion Index**:
   - Signal: Cumulative power consumption for AI training/deployment exceeds X GW, generating measurable infrared anomalies
   - Current Status (Early 2026): ~150 GW; rising ~15% annually
   - Action Condition: If annual growth exceeds 20% OR total reaches 500 GW within 12 months, escalate to Tier 2 protocols

2. **Data Center Visibility Incidents**:
   - Signal: Deliberate or accidental revelation of AI compute facility locations, power outputs, or architectural specifications to external parties (media, competitors, nations)
   - Current Status: Moderate incidents (e.g., public announcements of mega-scale datacenters); no systematic secrecy protocol
   - Action Condition: If sensitive facility specifications leak to foreign actors, activate information containment protocol

3. **Radio Transmission Escalation**:
   - Signal: Uncoordinated scientific or commercial transmissions broadcasting civilization-level technological achievements (e.g., AI milestone announcements, open-source model releases, scientific preprints disclosing AI capabilities)
   - Current Status: Ongoing (preprints, conferences, commercial announcements happen daily without "cosmic silence" consideration)
   - Action Condition: If coordinated international transmission stealth protocol is NOT established by Q2 2026, risk escalates exponentially

4. **Geopolitical Secrecy Breakdown**:
   - Signal: Competing powers (US, China, EU, etc.) pursue AI dominance through **public capability races** rather than stealth development
   - Current Status: Active; each power announces AI breakthroughs to maintain perceived technological leadership
   - Action Condition: If public announcement competition intensifies, convene emergency international coordination on transmission stealth

#### **Tier 2: Intermediate Signals (12-24 months)**

5. **Megastructure Development Initiation**:
   - Signal: Civilization begins construction of large-scale energy infrastructure specifically to power ASI (e.g., fusion arrays, solar collectors, orbital mirrors)
   - Hypothesized Manifestation: Government or corporate announcement of "ASI Energy Initiative" with visible construction activity
   - Action Condition: If megastructure development begins WITHOUT stealth protocols in place, assume Dark Forest strike risk rises to CRITICAL

6. **Cosmic Signal Compromise**:
   - Signal: Evidence or credible claim that Earth's presence has been detected by external intelligence (e.g., responding radio signals, probe arrival, mathematical pattern in cosmic phenomena)
   - Hypothesized Manifestation: SETI detection of anomalous signal; astronomers observe artifact signatures in nearby star systems
   - Action Condition: If detection occurs, shift immediately to survival protocols (see B1 Responses)

7. **Stealth Protocol Failure**:
   - Signal: Developed stealth protocols for AI (if any) are violated or circumvented due to competitive or institutional pressure
   - Hypothesized Manifestation: A major AI lab breaks agreed-upon transmission silence protocols to announce breakthrough; others follow
   - Action Condition: If stealth protocols collapse, assume strike window is open (1-10 year horizons)

### 📊 Confidence & Uncertainty Assessment

#### **Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**
The Dark Forest theory is logically coherent and consistent with the Fermi Paradox (the "Great Silence"). However, it rests on several unverified assumptions about extraterrestrial behavior and the prevalence of aggressive civilizations.

#### **Core Uncertainties:**
1. **Extraterrestrial Existence Uncertainty**: We don't know if advanced civilizations actually exist in our cosmic neighborhood
2. **Dark Forest Assumption**: Assumes civilizations must be hostile/paranoid; alternatives include cooperation, diplomacy, or non-interference norms
3. **Detection Threshold**: What power signature actually triggers external attention? 1 GW? 1 TW? Unknown
4. **Time Scale Uncertainty**: How fast could a strike arrive once detected? Light-speed limited (4.37 years from nearest star), allowing response time
5. **Communication vs. Kinetic Risk**: Are strikes kinetic (physical) or informational (hacking, signal-based)? Changes defense strategy

#### **Boundary Conditions (When This Filter Might NOT Apply):**
- If the universe is **spatially sparse** (advanced civilizations are extremely rare or absent)
- If an **intergalactic cooperation framework** exists that prevents strikes on emerging civilizations
- If Dark Forest competition is not the dominant mode (e.g., civilizations follow "Prime Directive" non-interference)
- If **distance barriers** prevent detection or arrival of strike forces before we achieve defensive capabilities
- If we **achieve stealth sufficiently** that we remain invisible despite high power consumption (e.g., heat dissipation to space, far-side development)

#### **Related Filters to Consider (Interaction):**
- **B2 (Berserker)**: Alternative external threat; if B1 triggers, B2 becomes moot (already destroyed)
- **B3 (Quarantine)**: Contradictory; if B3 is true, B1 strikes are prevented by watchers
- **B4 (Simulation)**: Could mitigate B1 (simulation provides protection from external strikes)
- **C1 (Compute Limits)**: If C1 is real, stealth is easier (less power needed for ASI)
- **C4 (Inward Turn)**: Supports B1 survival (civilizations that turn inward become invisible, avoiding B1)
