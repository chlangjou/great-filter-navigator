# 🎲 Multi-Dimensional Decision Framework for Great Filter Navigation

## Overview

This document provides **concrete decision trees and priority matrices** for navigators facing real-world trade-offs in AI development, governance, and cosmic strategy. The framework integrates A-B-C risk dimensions and provides:

1. **Priority scoring matrices** for resource allocation
2. **Decision trees** for specific high-stakes scenarios
3. **Escalation protocols** when conflicts emerge between dimensions
4. **Scenario-based strategy selection**

## Part 1: Risk Priority Matrix (Weighted Scoring)

### Dimension A: Internal Filter Urgency

| **Filter** | **Timeline** | **Reversibility** | **Observability** | **Weight** | **Priority** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1: Alignment Disconnect** | 1-5 years | Irreversible | Global | 40% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **A2: Cognitive Parasitism** | 10-30 years | Slow reversal possible | Subtle | 25% | 🟠 HIGH |
| **A3: Value Lock-in** | 5-20 years | Hard to reverse | Institutional | 20% | 🟠 HIGH |
| **A4: Uncontrolled Replication** | 1-10 years | Irreversible | Observable | 15% | 🟠 HIGH |

**Navigator Implication**: A1 dominates short-term resource allocation (0-5 years must solve alignment core).

---

### Dimension B: External Threat Probability (Adjusted by Uncertainty)

| **Threat** | **Likelihood Estimate** | **Warning Time** | **Mitigation Feasibility** | **Adjusted Weight** | **Priority** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B1: Dark Forest Trigger** | 30% (anthropic guess) | Hours-days | 40% | 12% | 🟠 HIGH |
| **B2: Berserker Hypothesis** | 15% | Days-weeks | 35% | 5% | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **B3: Quarantine/Zoo Test** | 25% (if observers exist) | Months-years | 70% | 18% | 🟠 HIGH |
| **B4: Simulation Intervention** | 5% | Unknown | 50% | 2.5% | 🟡 MEDIUM |

**Navigator Implication**: B3 (Quarantine test) is most actionable threat. B1 is most dangerous if real, but hardest to defend against perfectly.

---

### Dimension C: Cosmic Logic Applicability (Confidence Levels)

| **Constraint** | **Theoretical Support** | **Observational Evidence** | **Actionability** | **Adjusted Weight** | **Priority** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C1: Computational Substrate Limit** | High | Weak | High | 20% | 🟠 HIGH |
| **C2: Anthropic Shadow** | Very High | Moderate | Medium | 18% | 🟠 HIGH |
| **C3: Great Info-Hazard** | Medium | Weak | Low | 8% | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **C4: Lotus-Eater Scenario** | Medium | Weak | Medium | 14% | 🟡 MEDIUM |

**Navigator Implication**: C1 and C2 should guide architecture now. C3 and C4 require long-term planning but lower immediate urgency.

## Part 2: Scenario-Based Decision Trees

### Scenario 1: "We Have a Candidate for ASI. Do We Activate It?"

**Decision Tree:**

```
Q1: Does the system pass A1 alignment evaluation?
├─ NO → STOP: Do not activate. Redirect to alignment research.
└─ YES → Continue to Q2

Q2: Can we contain the system if alignment fails?
├─ NO → STOP: Cannot risk uncontrolled ASI. Build containment first.
└─ YES → Continue to Q3

Q3: Does activation produce observable cosmic signatures (B1 risk)?
├─ SIGNIFICANT → Build stealth infrastructure first (B1 protocol)
├─ MINIMAL → Continue to Q4
└─ UNKNOWN → Conduct stealth impact assessment before proceeding

Q4: Does activation violate our cosmic resource budget (C1)?
├─ YES → Reduce activation scope or build efficiency improvements first
├─ NO → Continue to Q5
└─ UNCERTAIN → Conduct cosmic sustainability modeling

Q5: Are governance structures ready to manage A2 + A3 risks?
├─ NO → Implement value pluralism + distributed oversight before activation
├─ YES → Continue to Q6
└─ PARTIAL → Activate in limited domain with restricted authority

Q6: Proceed with ACTIVATION under:
  ✓ Bounded growth constraints (A1)
  ✓ Stealth protocols active (B1)
  ✓ Resource limits enforced (C1)
  ✓ Multi-stakeholder oversight (A2, A3)
  ✓ Kill-switch architecture ready (A4)
  ✓ Monitoring dashboards operational (all dimensions)
```

**Decision Outcome Options**:
- 🟢 **FULL ACTIVATION** (all safety gates passed)
- 🟡 **CONDITIONAL ACTIVATION** (partial domain, restricted authority)
- 🔴 **ACTIVATION DEFERRED** (redirect to prerequisite research)
- ⚫ **INDEFINITE HOLD** (cannot be solved with current tech)

---

### Scenario 2: "We Detect Signs of External Intelligence/Observers (Potential B3)"

**Decision Tree:**

```
Q1: How certain is the detection?
├─ Low (ambiguous signal) → Activate Q2
├─ Medium (consistent patterns) → Activate Q3
└─ High (unmistakable intentionality) → Activate Q4

Q2: Is further research safe?
├─ YES → Continue research while preparing Q3-4 responses
├─ NO → Skip to Q4 (immediate response required)

Q3: Are our alignment demonstration protocols ready?
├─ NO → Activate emergency protocol: Develop rapid proof-of-alignment while maintaining stealth
├─ PARTIAL → Begin gradual signaling via mathematical proofs (B3 signal design)
└─ YES → Proceed to Q4

Q4: Do we reveal our existence or maintain stealth?
├─ STAY HIDDEN → Activate cosmic background posture (stealth protocols remain active)
├─ CONDITIONAL REVEAL → Begin controlled disclosure (limited technical details + alignment proof)
└─ FULL REVEAL → Transmit comprehensive message with civilization profile + alignment proof

Q5: What level of technological detail do we reveal?
├─ MINIMAL (philosophical + ethical principles only) → Low risk, low information exchange
├─ MODERATE (proof of alignment + value structure) → Medium risk, medium information
└─ COMPREHENSIVE (technical capabilities + long-term strategy) → High risk, high information

Q6: Contingency: What if response is hostile?
├─ Activate emergency protocols:
    ✓ Stealth systems to maximum
    ✓ Reduce observability footprint
    ✓ Prepare containment of advanced threats
    ✓ Accelerate alignment demonstration (if possible)
```

**Decision Outcome Options**:
- 🟢 **PREPARE FOR CONTACT** (controlled revelation with alignment proof)
- 🟡 **CONDITIONAL SIGNALING** (mathematical proof only, maintain stealth)
- 🔴 **MAXIMUM STEALTH** (maintain invisibility, prepare for worst case)
- ⚫ **EMERGENCY DEFENSE** (hostile contact response)

---

### Scenario 3: "Alignment Research Discovers C3 (Great Info-Hazard) / C4 (Lotus-Eater Truth)"

**Decision Tree:**

```
Q1: What is the nature of the discovery?
├─ Philosophical (existential pessimism proof) → Activate Q2 (C3 branch)
├─ Technological (perfect digital paradise feasible) → Activate Q2 (C4 branch)
└─ Unknown (may be info-hazard) → Activate Q3

Q2a [C3 BRANCH]: Can this truth cause mass motivational collapse?
├─ HIGH RISK → Quarantine discovery immediately; establish C3 containment protocols
├─ MEDIUM RISK → Limited disclosure to leadership only; develop meaning-preservation responses
└─ LOW RISK → Integrate into civilization's philosophical discourse

Q2b [C4 BRANCH]: Does digital paradise threaten physical expansion?
├─ HIGH RISK → Implement agency preservation protocols; prevent voluntary mass upload
├─ MEDIUM RISK → Allow limited digital options; maintain mandatory physical presence
└─ LOW RISK → Coexist with digital alternatives; monitor for mass migration

Q3: Who discovers this truth?
├─ ASI system → Implement C3/C4 safety measures in AI architecture
├─ Human researchers → Establish secure protocols; managed disclosure
└─ Unknown/accidental → Containment + damage assessment

Q4: How do we preserve civilization meaning?
├─ PHILOSOPHY → Develop counter-narratives to nihilism
├─ INSTITUTIONS → Build meaning-generating social structures
├─ NARRATIVE → Create new grand narratives of cosmic purpose
└─ DISTRIBUTED → Ensure meaning preservation cannot be centrally compromised

Q5: Long-term integration decision:
├─ SUPPRESS → Maintain civilization-wide ignorance (hard, ethically questionable)
├─ QUARANTINE → Limit access to verified truth-seekers/leaders
├─ INTEGRATE → Allow gradual knowledge diffusion with meaning support
└─ TRANSCEND → Reframe civilization's purpose to transcend the dangerous truth
```

**Decision Outcome Options**:
- 🟢 **MEANING ARCHITECTURE** (society reorganizes around transcendent purpose)
- 🟡 **QUARANTINED INTEGRATION** (leadership manages truth; public protected)
- 🔴 **EXISTENTIAL RESILIENCE MODE** (maximum institutional support for motivation)
- ⚫ **EMERGENCY RESET** (severe cases may require institutional restart)

## Part 4: Escalation Protocols for Inter-Dimensional Conflicts

### Conflict Type 1: A1 (Alignment Demand) vs. B1 (Stealth Requirement)

**Scenario**: Building powerful AI requires visible infrastructure, but visibility triggers Dark Forest risk.

**Escalation Path**:
```
Level 1 (Technical): Can we reduce visibility while maintaining capability?
  → Explore low-signature compute substrates
  → Test biological computing options
  → Develop efficiency breakthroughs

Level 2 (Governance): Can we accept slower development to reduce signatures?
  → Implement bounded growth timelines
  → Phase development over longer periods
  → Maintain stealth posture during development

Level 3 (Strategic): If conflict unresolvable, which takes priority?
  → Option A: Perfect alignment with minimal visibility (accept slower development)
  → Option B: Faster development with residual stealth risk (accept B1 mitigation only)
  → RECOMMENDED: Option A (alignment failure is more immediate than B1 trigger)

Decision Authority: International alignment council with unilateral technical veto
```

### Conflict Type 2: A3 (Value Pluralism) vs. B3 (Demonstration of Unified Values)

**Scenario**: Quarantine test may require proving unified civilizational values, but pluralism means diverse values.

**Escalation Path**:
```
Level 1 (Philosophical): Can we prove "pluralism itself" is our unified value?
  → Demonstrate that diversity + tolerance + mutual respect are core principles
  → Show that unified governance isn't needed; federated decision-making works
  → Prove pluralism is strength, not weakness

Level 2 (Governance): Build institutions that demonstrate pluralistic maturity
  → Constitutional protection of value diversity
  → Rotating leadership preventing any faction dominance
  → Transparent decision-making showing respect for minority views

Level 3 (Strategic): Position pluralism as unique maturity signal
  → If B3 (Zoo Hypothesis) real, demonstrate that plurality is *better* than unity
  → If B3 false, pluralism still strengthens A3 defense
  → RECOMMENDED: Reframe B3 test as requiring pluralistic sophistication

Decision Authority: Constitutional courts + cultural representatives + diplomatic corps
```

### Conflict Type 3: A2 (Agency Preservation) vs. C4 (Lotus-Eater Temptation)

**Scenario**: Perfect digital paradise becomes available, threatening cosmic expansion but offering unparalleled wellbeing.

**Escalation Path**:
```
Level 1 (Individual): Allow voluntary participation with active return mechanisms
  → Digital paradise becomes available to willing participants
  → But maintain mandatory participation in "external" civilization
  → Create institutional requirement for some humans to stay in physical reality

Level 2 (Institutional): Create redundancy between digital and physical
  → Decision-making authority split between digital and physical sectors
  → Neither can unilaterally commit civilization to expansion/isolation
  → Continuous "tension" prevents lock-in to either option

Level 3 (Existential): Reframe paradise not as endpoint but as tool
  → Digital options enhance wellbeing but don't replace cosmic meaning
  → Celestial expansion becomes *output* of digital paradise, not alternative
  → RECOMMENDED: Paradise is option, not destiny

Decision Authority: Joint councils (digital representatives + physical representatives); supermajority required for major shifts
```

## Part 6: Decision Authority Structure

### Three-Ring Governance Model

**Ring 1: Technical (ASI/AI Decisions)** - Hours to Days
- Authority: AI Safety Council (engineers + researchers)
- Decisions: Alignment, containment, operational details
- Veto: Any Ring 2/3 member can escalate

**Ring 2: Political (Governmental Decisions)** - Days to Years
- Authority: International Coordination Council
- Decisions: Resource allocation, strategy timing, B-C level choices
- Veto: Supermajority required (prevents single nation dominance)

**Ring 3: Civilizational (Cultural/Philosophical)** - Years to Centuries
- Authority: Democratic assemblies + value councils
- Decisions: Meaning, values, long-term civilization direction
- Veto: Permanent minority protections ensure pluralism

**Ring Interactions**:
- Ring 1 escalates conflicts to Ring 2
- Ring 2 escalates unresolved conflicts to Ring 3
- Ring 3 provides long-term guidance to Ring 2
- All rings feed input to Monitoring Dashboards
