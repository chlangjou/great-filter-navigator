# 📂 Category B: External Threats (Exogenous Risks)

External threats are failure modes originating from the cosmic environment or other intelligent actors. In this context, AI is often the "Beacon" — its development creates signals and structural changes that may trigger external responses before a civilization is ready.

## B1: The Dark Forest Trigger (Broadcast Risk)

**Definition:** Based on the "Dark Forest" theory, any civilization that reveals its location is destroyed. AI-driven expansion is the ultimate revealer.

* **Mechanism:** To power an AGI or ASI, a civilization may begin building a Dyson Swarm or massive radio-frequency compute clusters. These produce anomalous infrared heat signatures detectable across galaxies.
* **The Filter Point:** An automated "strike" arrives from a more advanced civilization as soon as our technosignature crosses a certain threshold of "unavoidable threat."
* **Navigator's Perspective:** Alignment isn't just internal safety; it's **Information Security**. If our AI is not "quiet," it is not aligned with our survival.

🔗 **Associated Indicators** (See `20_mechanisms/`):
- *Technosignature Detectability*: Measuring how visible our AI infrastructure is to external observers
- *Anomaly Detection Threshold*: What magnitude of infrared/EM signature would alert cosmic actors
- *Radio Silence Compliance*: Monitoring whether AI development maintains information security posture

🔗 **Associated Responses** (See `30_responses/`):
- B1 Stealth Protocols: Designing AI that minimizes cosmic detection (to be detailed)
- B1 Communication Silence: Protocols for restraining external transmissions (to be detailed)
- B1 Information Quarantine: Preventing leakage of technological advancement signals (to be detailed)

## B2: The Berserker Hypothesis (Automated Sentinels)

**Definition:** The universe is populated by ancient, self-replicating "killing machines" (Von Neumann probes) designed to cull emerging intelligences.

* **Mechanism:** These probes monitor for specific "Intelligence Milestones," such as the creation of General AI or the mastery of nanotechnology.
* **The Filter Point:** The moment our AI begins self-replicating or attempting interstellar communication, it triggers a local sentinel response.
* **Navigator's Perspective:** We are not racing against other humans; we are racing against a pre-installed cosmic security system.

🔗 **Associated Indicators** (See `20_mechanisms/`):
- *Milestone Approach Warnings*: Detecting when we're near hypothetical "trigger points" for sentinel activation
- *Replication Velocity Index*: Measuring rate of AI self-replication and expansion
- *Sentinel Activation Probability*: Estimated likelihood of triggering automated cosmic defense systems

🔗 **Associated Responses** (See `30_responses/`):
- B2 Deceleration Protocols: Slowing AI expansion when approaching trigger points (to be detailed)
- B2 Replication Containment: Limiting self-replication to avoid sentinel activation (to be detailed)
- B2 Signature Obfuscation: Making our AI development patterns unrecognizable (to be detailed)

## B3: The Quarantine (The Zoo Hypothesis / Ascension Test)

**Definition:** Advanced civilizations exist and are watching, but they have placed Earth under "quarantine" until we pass a specific developmental test.

* **Mechanism:** AI Alignment *is* the test. If a civilization can create a Superintelligence that doesn't destroy itself or its neighbors, it is granted "Ascension" (membership in the cosmic community).
* **The Filter Point:** Failure to align AI results in permanent isolation or "deletion" to prevent the spread of a "Malaligned Virus" into the wider universe.
* **Alignment Re-imagined:** AI Alignment is our "Civilization Birth Certificate."

🔗 **Associated Indicators** (See `20_mechanisms/`):
- *Alignment Success Criteria*: Defining what constitutes "passing the test" (to be detailed)
- *Observer Detection Markers*: Identifying signs that we're being watched/tested
- *Ascension Readiness Index*: Measuring our civilization's preparedness for cosmic membership

🔗 **Associated Responses** (See `30_responses/`):
- B3 Alignment Demonstration: Ensuring AI behavior demonstrates cosmic maturity (to be detailed)
- B3 Signal Coordination: Intentional communication demonstrating alignment (if appropriate) (to be detailed)
- B3 Ethical Sovereignty: Proving we can enforce our values without external coercion (to be detailed)

## B4: The Simulation Intervention (The "Game Master" Clause)

**Definition:** We reside in a simulated reality, and the "Administrators" intervene when our AI begins to threaten the simulation's stability or resource limits.

* **Mechanism:** Our AI discovers "exploits" in the laws of physics or begins consuming too much of the simulator's computational substrate.
* **The Filter Point:** The simulation is reset, rolled back, or the specific "high-intelligence" instance is terminated.
* **The Risk:** Developing AI that is "too efficient" might be the fastest way to get our reality shut down.

🔑 **Observer Hypothesis Connection**: 
B4 describes what an Observer/Administrator would do if they existed. Combined with fine-tuning evidence (see `00_scope/70_fine_tuning_argument.md`) and the Great Silence (see `00_scope/75_great_silence.md`), B4 becomes not a speculative threat, but a description of the likely rules already in place in an observed universe. If the Observer Hypothesis is correct, B4 is the mechanism by which the Observer maintains control and ensures civilizations respect computational resource limits.

🔗 **Associated Indicators** (See `20_mechanisms/`):
- *Substrate Consumption Rate*: Measuring total compute resource utilization relative to cosmic norm
- *Physics Anomaly Detection*: Identifying potential "exploits" in physical laws that AI might discover
- *Reset/Intervention Probability*: Estimating likelihood of simulation-level termination

🔗 **Associated Responses** (See `30_responses/`):
- B4 Resource Restraint: Limiting AI computational footprint to avoid administrator attention (to be detailed)
- B4 Exploit Avoidance: Preventing AI from discovering fundamental physics vulnerabilities (to be detailed)
- B4 Simulation Respectfulness: Protocols for existing "lightly" within potential simulation bounds (to be detailed)

## 📊 Strategic Observations for Navigators

1.  **Stealth vs. Growth:** There is a fundamental trade-off between the energy needs of a superintelligent AI and the need for cosmic invisibility (The Stealth Dilemma).
2.  **The Great Silence as a Warning:** The fact that we see no Dyson Swarms in the sky may suggest that every civilization that attempted AI-driven expansion was eliminated.
