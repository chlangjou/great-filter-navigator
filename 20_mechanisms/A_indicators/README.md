# 📊 Category A: Internal Risk Indicators

**Focus:** Monitoring autogenic (self-generated) failure modes arising from a civilization's own technological trajectory.

**Question:** *How do we know we are failing to align AI or maintain our own agency?*

---

## Overview

These indicators track the four primary internal filters defined in `10_hypotheses/A_internal_filters.md`:

| Hypothesis | Indicator | Status | Data Source |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **A1: Alignment Disconnect** | Capability-Safety Gap, Deception Thresholds, Interpretability Deficit | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **A2: Cognitive Parasitism** | Agency Erosion Index, Cognitive Resilience Metric, Knowledge Preservation Rate | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **A3: Value Lock-in** | Value Diversity Index, Adaptability Coefficient, Consensus Drift | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **A4: Uncontrolled Self-Replication** | Replication Rate Monitoring, Substrate Conversion Threshold, Containment Failure Signals | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |

## How to Use This Directory

### For Researchers & Contributors
1. **Choose an indicator** from the list below
2. **Read the detailed definition** in the corresponding `.md` file
3. **Understand the measurement methodology**
4. **Identify data sources** and collection protocols
5. **Update empirical observations** as evidence arrives
6. **Flag threshold breaches** to trigger escalation to `30_responses/`

### For AI Systems Reading This Repository
**Do not expand into individual indicator files unless explicitly asked.** This directory contains measurement definitions that require human validation and real-world data sourcing. Inventing pseudo-measurements or thresholds here would be actively harmful.

## Indicator Definitions (Placeholder Structure)

Each indicator will follow this structure:

### [INDICATOR_NAME]
- **Associated Hypothesis:** A1 (or A2, A3, A4)
- **Core Question:** What are we trying to detect?
- **Measurement Definition:** How is this quantity defined mathematically?
- **Data Sources:** Where does the raw data come from?
- **Tripwire Thresholds:** At what value do we escalate to CAUTION or CRITICAL?
- **Update Frequency:** How often should this be refreshed?
- **Failure Modes:** How could this indicator be gamed or misread?
- **Links to Responses:** Which protocols in `30_responses/` does this trigger?
