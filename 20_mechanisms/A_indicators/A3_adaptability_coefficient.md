# 📊 A3.2: Adaptability Coefficient

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/A_internal_filters.md#a3-the-value-lock-in-ethical-ossification`

**Core Question:** Can civilization actually change its values and moral systems when circumstances demand it?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Adaptability Coefficient** measures:
- Speed and ease of value system change when needed
- Institutional mechanisms enabling moral evolution
- Resistance forces that prevent value change
- Historical evidence of values actually changing in response to challenges

### The Core Metric
```
Adaptability = (Historical_Value_Change_Rate / Environmental_Change_Rate) × 
               (Ease_of_Value_Evolution / Institutional_Resistance)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Coefficient > 1.0** = Values adapt faster than (or match) environmental change (NOMINAL)
- **Coefficient 0.5-1.0** = Values changing but slower than needed (CAUTION)
- **Coefficient < 0.5** = Values cannot adapt to rate of change; lock-in occurring (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
Value diversity means little if civilization cannot actually use that diversity. Adaptability measures whether values can evolve when old values fail to address new challenges.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal A3.2a: Historical Value System Evolution

**What to measure:**
- Rate of major value system changes over past 50, 100, 200 years
- Compare rate of moral/ethical change to technological and environmental change
- Examples of successful major value shifts (abolition, democracy, human rights, environmental ethics)
- Speed of adoption of new moral frameworks

**Data sources:**
- Historical analysis and case studies
- Research on cultural and moral change
- Philosophical and theological literature
- Demographic and sociological data
- Public opinion polling over time

**Assessment framework:**
| Evolution Rate | Status | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Major value shifts every 30-50 years; rapid adoption | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization can change values when needed |
| Major shifts every 50-100 years; slower adoption | 🟡 CAUTION | Values changing but not keeping pace |
| No major value shifts in centuries; stagnant | 🔴 CRITICAL | Values are locked; change is blocked |

**Frequency:** Biennial historical analysis; annual trending of current changes

---

### Signal A3.2b: Institutional Mechanisms for Value Change

**What to measure:**
- Existence of formal mechanisms for moral/ethical deliberation and change

- Case studies of moral policy changes
- Institutional responsiveness studies

**Assessment framework:**
| Mechanisms | Status | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Strong deliberative processes; institutions adapt to moral change | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization has structures for value evolution |
| Some mechanisms; slower institutional response | 🟡 CAUTION | Institutions resist moral change |
| Weak or absent mechanisms; institutions resist change | 🔴 CRITICAL | Institutional lock-in prevents value evolution |

**Frequency:** Annual institutional assessment; quarterly policy tracking

---

### Signal A3.2c: Resistance to Value Change

**What to measure:**

**Assessment framework:**
| Resistance Level | Status | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Low resistance; moral change is expected and accepted | 🟢 NOMINAL | Values can evolve; old systems can be replaced |
| Moderate resistance; change possible but opposed | 🟡 CAUTION | Value evolution is being blocked/delayed |
| High resistance; change blocked; status quo defended | 🔴 CRITICAL | Institutional/cultural lock-in preventing evolution |

**Frequency:** Annual assessment; quarterly incident tracking

---

### Signal A3.2d: Response to Moral Crises

**What to measure:**
- When civilization faces moral crises (slavery abolished, treatment of women changes, environmental protection demanded), does it adapt values?
- Speed of response: How quickly does society shift moral consensus?
- Completeness: Are changes thorough or superficial?
- Durability: Do changes stick or do old values re-emerge?

**Data sources:**
- Case studies of major moral crises and responses
- Historical analysis
- Polling on moral attitudes over time
- Research on social change and institutionalization
- Incident analysis of value-based conflicts

**Assessment framework:**
| Crisis Response | Status | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Fast, thorough, durable response to moral crises | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization adapts values to changed understanding |
| Slow response; incomplete change; regression risk | 🟡 CAUTION | Civilization struggling to adapt |
| No response; old values maintained despite crisis | 🔴 CRITICAL | Values locked in despite evidence of inadequacy |

**Frequency:** Case-by-case analysis as crises emerge; annual synthesis

## 4. Interpretation Guidance

### High Adaptability (NOMINAL)
- **Meaning**: Values evolve when circumstances demand; lock-in risk is low
- **Implication**: Civilization can course-correct if values become inadequate
- **Action**: Maintain institutional mechanisms for moral deliberation; protect debate space

### Moderate Adaptability (CAUTION)
- **Meaning**: Values can change but with significant delay and resistance
- **Implication**: Civilization may not adapt fast enough to stay ahead of challenges
- **Actions**: 
  - Strengthen mechanisms for moral deliberation
  - Reduce institutional barriers to value change
  - Support advocates for moral evolution
  - Accelerate speed of institutional response
  - Create incentives for value system flexibility

### Low Adaptability (CRITICAL)
- **Meaning**: Values are locked in; civilization cannot adapt even when needed
- **Implication**: Civilization is brittle; values that once made sense will lead to failure
- **Actions**: Trigger A3 emergency protocols
  - Break institutional resistance to value change
  - Create new mechanisms for moral evolution
  - Reduce penalty for proposing alternative values
  - Restore deliberative capacity
  - Force re-examination of locked-in values

## 5. Failure Modes & Limitations

### How This Indicator Could Be Misread

**False Positive Risk:**
- *Rhetoric vs. reality*: Institutions claim to support value change while blocking it
- *Partial adaptation*: Making superficial changes while core values remain locked
- *Historical cherry-picking*: Pointing to past changes while current situation is rigidifying

**False Negative Risk:**
- *Slow normalization*: Lock-in happens gradually, not suddenly; easy to miss until too late
- *Latent resistance*: Institutions seem adaptable until actual change is demanded
- *Underestimating inertia*: Core cultural values may be more locked than apparent

### How to Mitigate
1. **Test under pressure**: When value change is actually demanded, can it happen?
2. **Monitor resistance mechanisms**: Watch for institutional hardening
3. **Track failed reform attempts**: How many value-change proposals get blocked?
4. **Compare to environmental change**: Are values evolving at pace needed?
5. **Long-term perspective**: Judge adaptability over decades, not moments

## 6. Connection to Response Protocols

This indicator directly triggers escalation to the following responses (see `30_responses/A_internal_alignment/`):

| Adaptability Level | Primary Response | Escalation Path |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| > 1.0 (NOMINAL) | **A3.2a**: Support value evolution mechanisms | Continue current trajectory |
| 0.5-1.0 (CAUTION) | **A3.2b**: Reduce institutional barriers | Governance coordination required |
| < 0.5 (CRITICAL) | **A3.2c**: Emergency institutional reform | Civilizational intervention |

## 7. Related Indicators & Cross-Filter Links

### Complementary Indicators in A3 Category
- **A3.1 (Value Diversity Index)**: Diverse values are pointless if they can't lead to adaptation
- **A3.3 (Consensus Drift)**: Tracks whether adaptability is declining over time

### A-Filter Cross-Links
- **A1 (Alignment Disconnect)**: Rigid values make changing alignment approach difficult
- **A2 (Cognitive Parasitism)**: Lost adaptability makes value innovation impossible
- **A4 (Uncontrolled Replication)**: Adaptability allows civilizations to redefine "acceptable"

### C-Filter Implications
- **C4 (Inward Turn)**: Adaptability allows choosing between expansion and digital paradise
