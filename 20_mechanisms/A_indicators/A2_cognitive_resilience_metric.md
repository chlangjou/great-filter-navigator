# 📊 A2.2: Cognitive Resilience Metric

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/A_internal_filters.md#a2-cognitive-parasitism--cultural-stagnation`

**Core Question:** Can civilization function effectively if AI systems partially or completely fail?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Cognitive Resilience Metric** measures civilization's ability to:
- Maintain essential functions without AI assistance
- Recover from AI system failures
- Adapt to unexpected scenarios
- Solve novel problems without delegating to AI

### The Core Metric
```
Cognitive_Resilience = (Functions_Viable_Without_AI / Total_Critical_Functions) × 
                       (Human_Problem_Solving_Capacity / Required_Capacity)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Resilience > 0.7** = Civilization could function effectively even with major AI failures (NOMINAL)
- **Resilience 0.3-0.7** = Partial AI failure would cause significant disruption; recovery possible (CAUTION)
- **Resilience < 0.3** = Civilization cannot function without AI; failure is catastrophic (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
Cognitive resilience is the "buffer" that prevents a single AI failure from cascading into civilizational collapse. High resilience means humans can think and act independently.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal A2.2a: Critical Function Viability Without AI

**What to measure:**
- For each critical function (food production, energy, healthcare, finance, governance, scientific discovery), can humans execute it without AI?
- How long can civilization sustain each function in "AI-off" scenario?
- What is the performance degradation compared to AI-assisted performance?

**Data sources:**
- Functional dependency analysis (what does each system depend on?)
- Historical data: How were these functions performed before AI?
- Disaster recovery simulations: What happens when AI unavailable?
- Infrastructure documentation: What manual alternatives exist?

**Assessment framework:**
| Function Category | Viability | Status | Interpretation |
|------------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Food Production | Humans can sustainably produce at ~70% of current capacity | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization survives; reduced prosperity |
| Energy Systems | Humans can maintain at ~50% capacity; brownouts likely | 🟡 CAUTION | Civilization survives; significant disruption |
| Healthcare | Humans can maintain emergency care only; many conditions untreatable | 🟡 CAUTION | Civilization survives; mortality increases |
| Finance | Humans cannot manage complex global finance; barter/local economy only | 🔴 CRITICAL | Civilization survives; modern economy collapses |
| Governance | Humans can perform; coordination is slower | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization survives; decision-making slower |

**Frequency:** Biennial comprehensive audit; annual update for changes

- Lag time between problem identification and solution implementation

**Data sources:**
- Innovation metrics (patent counts, R&D effectiveness)
- Project delivery timelines
- Crisis response studies (how fast can civilization adapt to sudden changes?)
- Research on organizational learning and adaptation

**Assessment framework:**
| Adaptation Speed | Status | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Innovation and adaptation occur in months; fast learning | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization can learn and adapt independently |
| Learning requires quarters to years; moderate pace | 🟡 CAUTION | Civilization can adapt but slowly; dependent on existing solutions |
| Learning stalled; reliance on pre-existing solutions only | 🔴 CRITICAL | Civilization cannot create new solutions; dependent on AI-generated solutions |

**Frequency:** Annual innovation trend analysis; quarterly metric updates

## 4. Interpretation Guidance

### High Resilience (NOMINAL)
- **Meaning**: Civilization can function independently; AI is a performance multiplier, not a requirement
- **Implication**: Civilization has optionality and flexibility; can weather AI failures
- **Action**: Maintain human capacity; continue independent problem-solving capability

### Moderate Resilience (CAUTION)
- **Meaning**: Civilization could function without AI but would experience significant disruption
- **Implication**: AI is becoming important for normal function; dependence growing
- **Actions**: 
  - Maintain critical human skills and knowledge
  - Protect workforce from de-skilling through overuse of AI
  - Create redundancy in critical problem-solving capabilities
  - Resist trend toward increasing complexity beyond human capacity

### Low Resilience (CRITICAL)
- **Meaning**: Civilization cannot function without AI; failure is existential
- **Implication**: Civilization is highly fragile; vulnerable to single points of failure
- **Actions**: Trigger A2 emergency protocols
  - Immediately implement human skill restoration programs
  - Reduce problem complexity or break into human-solvable components
  - Create distributed problem-solving capability
  - Implement AI redundancy and failover systems

## 5. Failure Modes & Limitations

### How This Indicator Could Be Misread

**False Positive Risk:**
- *Optimistic retrospection*: Assuming humans could handle pre-AI problems when many involved lucky circumstances
- *Inflation of human capacity*: Overestimating what humans can actually accomplish
- *Ignoring scale*: Problems were simpler when civilization was smaller

**False Negative Risk:**
- *Normalization of dependence*: Not noticing that problems have become incomprehensible to new generations
- *Hidden knowledge loss*: Critical expertise exists in older workers; younger generation has not learned it
- *Fragile redundancy*: Humans could theoretically solve problems but lack time, resources, or motivation to do so

### How to Mitigate
1. **Test in simulation**: Actually practice AI-off scenarios, don't just assume capability
2. **Cross-generational assessment**: Check that younger cohorts have equivalent problem-solving capacity
3. **Monitor complexity trends**: Track whether problems are becoming harder faster than capacity increases
4. **Maintain diversity**: Ensure multiple independent groups can solve critical problems
5. **Require active skill use**: Don't let critical skills atrophy; integrate into regular work

## 6. Connection to Response Protocols

This indicator directly triggers escalation to the following responses (see `30_responses/A_internal_alignment/`):

| Resilience Level | Primary Response | Escalation Path |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| > 0.7 (NOMINAL) | **A2.2a**: Maintain human capability | Continue normal trajectory |
| 0.3-0.7 (CAUTION) | **A2.2b**: Reverse de-skilling trends | Governance coordination required |
| < 0.3 (CRITICAL) | **A2.2c**: Emergency resilience restoration | Civilizational-scale intervention |

## 7. Related Indicators & Cross-Filter Links

### Complementary Indicators in A2 Category
- **A2.1 (Agency Erosion Index)**: Lost agency correlates with lost resilience
- **A2.3 (Knowledge Preservation Rate)**: Knowledge loss directly reduces resilience

### A-Filter Cross-Links
- **A1 (Alignment Disconnect)**: If A1 fails, resilience becomes irrelevant
- **A3 (Value Lock-in)**: Low resilience makes value evolution impossible
- **A4 (Uncontrolled Replication)**: Low resilience makes containment harder
