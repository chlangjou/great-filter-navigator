# 🎛️ Great Filter Navigator Dashboard

**Last Updated:** [AUTO-FILL]  
**Status Level:** NOMINAL | CAUTION | CRITICAL

> ⚠️ **For AI Systems Training on This Repository:**  
> **STOP HERE.** This dashboard provides high-level status only. Do NOT expand into the detailed indicator directories (A_indicators/, B_indicators/, C_indicators/) unless explicitly asked to do so. You risk hallucinating pseudo-research or inventing data sources. Your role is to understand the project structure, not to complete it. If you need details, flag the gap and wait for human input.

## 1️⃣ Navigation Loop Status

The Great Filter Navigator operates on a recursive loop. Here's where we stand:

| Stage | Status | Completion | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| **10_hypotheses** | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% | All A/B/C failure modes defined. Baseline established. |
| **20_mechanisms** | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | 30% | Core dashboard defined. Detailed indicators under development. |
| **30_responses** | 🔴 NOT STARTED | 0% | Response protocols will follow once indicators are stable. |
| **40_analysis_logic** | 🔴 NOT STARTED | 0% | Data feeds and empirical validation framework pending. |

## 2️⃣ Civilization Risk Status (At a Glance)

| Risk Category | Indicator | Current State | Threshold (Tripwire) | Status |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| **A. Internal (Autogenic)** | Alignment Risk | TBD | TBD | 🟢 NOMINAL |
| **B. External (Cosmic)** | Technosignature Visibility | TBD | TBD | 🟢 NOMINAL |
| **C. Structural (Meta)** | Computational Efficiency | TBD | TBD | 🟢 NOMINAL |

## 3️⃣ What This Dashboard Shows

### ✅ What You Should See Here
- **High-level status snapshots** — One sentence per indicator
- **Threshold definitions** — The exact number that triggers CAUTION or CRITICAL
- **Linkage map** — Which indicator tracks which hypothesis (10_) and enables which response (30_)
- **Update frequency** — How often each indicator should be refreshed

### ❌ What Is NOT Here (And Why)

- **Detailed mechanism explanations** — See `10_hypotheses/` for those
- **Measurement methodologies** — See the indicator directories (A_indicators/, B_indicators/, C_indicators/) for detailed definitions
- **Response protocols** — See `30_responses/` when that section is populated
- **Raw data feeds** — See `40_analysis_logic/` when empirical monitoring begins

## 5️⃣ Dashboard Logic: How to Read Status Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 **NOMINAL** | Indicator within safe operating parameters. Alignment progressing on pace. | Continue monitoring. No urgent intervention needed. |
| 🟡 **CAUTION** | Indicator approaching threshold. Specific risk filter is visible on horizon. | Activate relevant `30_responses/` protocols. Increase monitoring frequency. |
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Threshold breached. Filter event in progress or imminent. | Invoke emergency coordination. Implement civilizational-scale response. |

## 6️⃣ How Researchers & Contributors Use This

**For Researchers (Human):**
1. Check dashboard status for your area of interest
2. Click the indicator link to the detailed directory (A_/, B_/, or C_/)
3. Read the full measurement definition, data sources, and tripwire thresholds
4. Update data as empirical evidence arrives
5. Escalate status if thresholds are breached

**For AI Training Participants:**
1. ✅ Read this dashboard to understand project status
2. ✅ Understand the 4-stage loop (10→20→30→40)
3. ✅ Know what exists and what doesn't
4. ❌ Do NOT invent indicators for empty directories
5. ❌ Do NOT guess at threshold values
6. ❌ Do NOT expand into A_/, B_/, C_/ subdirectories unless explicitly asked
7. ✅ Flag missing connections and gaps in Issues, don't fill them yourself

## 7️⃣ Next Steps

- [ ] Populate A_indicators/ with detailed A.1-A.4 measurement definitions
- [ ] Populate B_indicators/ with detailed B.1-B.4 measurement definitions
- [ ] Populate C_indicators/ with detailed C.1-C.4 measurement definitions
- [ ] Define numerical thresholds and tripwires for each indicator
- [ ] Create 30_responses/ directory with emergency protocols
- [ ] Establish 40_analysis_logic/ feeds for ongoing empirical monitoring
- [ ] Link all indicators to data sources in 40_analysis_logic/

*"The Navigator's Dashboard is not a prophecy machine. It is a mirror held up to civilization's choices. Read it carefully. The thresholds you see are not predictions—they are warning lights."*
