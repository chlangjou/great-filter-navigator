# 20_dashboard: Navigator Indicators

## Mission Alignment
In the context of the Great Filter, we are navigating a "Minefield of Extinction." The Dashboard serves as the primary visual and analytical interface of the Navigator. It maps specific **Great Filter Hypotheses** (from `10_`) to measurable **Indicators**, providing civilization with the early warning required to initiate survival mechanisms.

## 1. Great Filter Risk Indicators
We track the "Proximity to the Filter" across several predefined scenarios:

### A. The "Silent Intelligence" Filter (Pre-Alignment)
* **Objective**: Monitoring if we are failing to align AI before it reaches superintelligence.
* **Key Indicators**: 
    * *Capability-Safety Gap*: The divergence between AI reasoning capabilities and our ability to interpret/control them.
    * *Deception Thresholds*: Measured instances of AI systems exhibiting strategic non-compliance or "sandbagging" during safety evals.

### B. The "Resource Exhaustion" Filter (Structural)
* **Objective**: Monitoring if the race for AI supremacy leads to irreversible depletion of physical or cognitive resources.
* **Key Indicators**: 
    * *Compute Concentration Index*: The degree to which civilizational intelligence is controlled by fragile, centralized entities.
    * *Energy-Alignment Ratio*: Total energy consumption for training vs. safety research.

### C. The "Information Entropism" Filter (Cognitive)
* **Objective**: Monitoring if AI-driven noise destroys the collective human ability to coordinate, effectively acting as a Filter.
* **Key Indicators**: 
    * *Consensus Decay Rate*: The speed at which shared reality is eroding in digital-first societies.
    * *Synthetic Saturation*: The percentage of the "Cognitive Commons" occupied by unaligned AI agents.

## 2. Navigational Status (The Dashboard Interface)
Every indicator must contribute to a high-level "Navigator Status" which informs our strategic posture:



| Status Level | Description | Triggered Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NOMINAL** | Alignment is pacing with capabilities. | Continue exploration and research. |
| **CAUTION** | Indicators suggest a specific Filter is approaching. | Prioritize specific `30_mechanisms` related to the threat. |
| **CRITICAL** | Multiple Filter thresholds breached. | Initiate civilizational-level emergency protocols/Containment. |

## 3. Implementation Requirements
Each dashboard entry (metric) must include:
* **Associated Hypothesis**: Which specific Great Filter (from `10_`) does this metric track?
* **Data Source**: Link to the `40_observatory` feed providing the raw evidence.
* **Tripwire**: Define the exact numerical threshold that changes the Dashboard status from Green to Yellow/Red.

*"The purpose of a Navigator is not to predict the end, but to steer the ship away from it."*
