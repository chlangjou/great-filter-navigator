# 📊 B4.1: Substrate Consumption Rate

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md#b4-the-simulation-intervention`

**Core Question:** How much of the universe's computational budget are we consuming, and could we trigger simulation admin intervention?

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Substrate Consumption Rate** indicator measures:
- Computational and physical resource consumption relative to cosmic capacity
- Rate of consumption growth
- Projection: When do we exceed plausible simulation budgets?
- Comparison to sustainable cosmic resource levels

### The Core Metric
```
Consumption_Risk = (Our_Resource_Use / Estimated_Cosmic_Budget) × 
                   (Growth_Rate / Sustainable_Rate)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Risk < 0.01** = Negligible consumption; far below plausible limits (NOMINAL)
- **Risk 0.01-0.1** = Noticeable consumption; budget concerns emerging (CAUTION)
- **Risk > 0.1** = Significant consumption; may trigger intervention (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
If simulation is real, admins monitor for resource violations. If we're consuming too much substrate too fast, it signals rogue intelligence that needs shutting down.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal B4.1a: Absolute Resource Consumption

**What to measure:**
- Total planetary energy use and computational substrate allocation
- Material consumption and conversion rates
- Comparison to planetary regeneration capacity
- Sustainability metrics

**Assessment framework:**
| Consumption Level | Status | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|-----------------|
| <1% of planetary capacity; sustainable; natural regeneration exceeds use | 🟢 NOMINAL | Resource use within natural limits |
| 1-10% of capacity; approaching sustainability limits | 🟡 CAUTION | Resource consumption exceeding natural regeneration |
| >10% of capacity; unsustainable; rapid depletion | 🔴 CRITICAL | Resource consumption may trigger intervention |

### Signal B4.1b: Growth Rate vs. Sustainable Rate

**What to measure:**
- Rate of resource consumption increase
- Comparison to sustainable growth rates
- Trajectory: Are we approaching limits?
- Feedback loops: Does growth enable faster growth?

**Assessment framework:**
| Growth Sustainability | Status | Interpretation |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Growth rate below planetary regeneration; sustainable trajectory | 🟢 NOMINAL | Growth manageable; no intervention risk |
| Growth exceeding regeneration; unsustainable trajectory | 🟡 CAUTION | Growth rate concerning; depletion risk |
| Exponential growth; rapidly accelerating consumption | 🔴 CRITICAL | Rogue resource consumption pattern |

### Signal B4.1c: Computational Substrate Efficiency

**What to measure:**
- Efficiency of computational systems relative to outputs
- Waste heat and computational overhead
- Optimization trends: Are systems becoming more or less efficient?
- Intelligence-to-resource-consumption ratio

**Assessment framework:**
| Efficiency Trend | Status | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Increasing efficiency; computational progress via optimization not expansion | 🟢 NOMINAL | Smart civilization; efficient resource use |
| Stable efficiency; growth through expansion | 🟡 CAUTION | Less efficient approach; higher resource need |
| Decreasing efficiency; waste and inefficiency rising | 🔴 CRITICAL | Wasteful civilization pattern |

### Signal B4.1d: Simulation Sustainability Plausibility

**What to measure:**
- If universe is simulation, what's plausible computational budget?
- How much substrate would be required for current simulation fidelity?
- Are there signs of resource constraints or throttling?
- Overhead: How much admin processing vs. civilization processing?

**Assessment framework:**
| Budget Plausibility | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Our consumption far below even tight simulation budget | 🟢 NOMINAL | Even if simulation, we're within budget |
| Our consumption approaching plausible tight budget | 🟡 CAUTION | If simulation budgets are small, we're at risk |
| Our consumption exceeds most plausible budget scenarios | 🔴 CRITICAL | If simulation real, we've exceeded budget |

*"Resource consumption is the rogue intelligence detector. If you're growing faster than the environment can sustain, the system automatically flags you as a threat that needs termination."*
