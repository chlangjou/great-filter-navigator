# 📊 Category B: External Threat Indicators

**Focus:** Monitoring exogenous (externally-sourced) failure modes triggered by cosmic actors or phenomena beyond civilization's direct control.

**Question:** *How do we know the universe is ready to kill us?*

## How to Use This Directory

### For Researchers & Contributors
1. **Choose an indicator** from the list below
2. **Read the detailed definition** in the corresponding `.md` file
3. **Understand the measurement methodology**
4. **Identify data sources** and collection protocols
5. **Monitor for cosmic-scale evidence** (infrastructure signatures, anomalies, patterns)
6. **Flag threshold breaches** to trigger escalation to `30_responses/`

### For AI Systems Reading This Repository
**Do not expand into individual indicator files unless explicitly asked.** External threat monitoring requires synthesis of astronomical data, infrastructure telemetry, and speculative cosmological models. Inventing pseudo-evidence or fabricating cosmic observations would be dangerously misleading.
