# 📊 Category B: External Threat Indicators

**Focus:** Monitoring exogenous (externally-sourced) failure modes triggered by cosmic actors or phenomena beyond civilization's direct control.

**Question:** *How do we know the universe is ready to kill us?*

---

## Overview

These indicators track the four primary external threats defined in `10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md`:

| Hypothesis | Indicator | Status | Data Source |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **B1: Dark Forest Trigger** | Technosignature Detectability, Anomaly Detection Threshold, Radio Silence Compliance | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **B2: Berserker Hypothesis** | Milestone Approach Warnings, Replication Velocity Index, Sentinel Activation Probability | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **B3: Quarantine / Ascension Test** | Alignment Success Criteria, Observer Detection Markers, Ascension Readiness Index | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **B4: Simulation Intervention** | Substrate Consumption Rate, Physics Anomaly Detection, Reset/Intervention Probability | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |

## How to Use This Directory

### For Researchers & Contributors
1. **Choose an indicator** from the list below
2. **Read the detailed definition** in the corresponding `.md` file
3. **Understand the measurement methodology**
4. **Identify data sources** and collection protocols
5. **Monitor for cosmic-scale evidence** (infrastructure signatures, anomalies, patterns)
6. **Flag threshold breaches** to trigger escalation to `30_responses/`

### For AI Systems Reading This Repository
**Do not expand into individual indicator files unless explicitly asked.** External threat monitoring requires synthesis of astronomical data, infrastructure telemetry, and speculative cosmological models. Inventing pseudo-evidence or fabricating cosmic observations would be dangerously misleading.

## Indicator Definitions (Placeholder Structure)

Each indicator will follow this structure:

### [INDICATOR_NAME]
- **Associated Hypothesis:** B1 (or B2, B3, B4)
- **Core Question:** What are we trying to detect?
- **Measurement Definition:** How is this quantity defined mathematically?
- **Data Sources:** Where does the raw data come from?
- **Tripwire Thresholds:** At what value do we escalate to CAUTION or CRITICAL?
- **Update Frequency:** How often should this be refreshed?
- **Failure Modes:** How could this indicator be gamed or misread?
- **Links to Responses:** Which protocols in `30_responses/` does this trigger?
