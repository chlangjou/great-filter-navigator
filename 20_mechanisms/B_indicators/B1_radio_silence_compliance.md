# 📊 B1.3: Radio Silence Compliance

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md#b1-the-dark-forest-trigger`

**Core Question:** Are external transmissions revealing our technological advancement and creating detectability risks?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Radio Silence Compliance** indicator measures:
- Intentional transmissions (broadcasts, deliberate signals) that might reveal our existence or technology level
- Unintended RF leakage from communications infrastructure
- Interstellar messages or signals sent deliberately
- Compliance with information security regarding technosignature containment

### The Core Metric
```
Radio_Silence_Compliance = (Transmissions_With_Secrecy / Total_Transmissions) × 
                           (Unintended_Leakage_Containment / Total_Emissions_Risk)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Compliance > 0.9** = Transmissions are disciplined; minimal leakage (NOMINAL)
- **Compliance 0.6-0.9** = Some uncontrolled emissions; growing leakage risk (CAUTION)
- **Compliance < 0.6** = Multiple deliberate broadcasts; clear security failures (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
Unlike heat signatures which we must generate to power civilization, transmissions are largely optional. Every broadcast is a choice to reveal ourselves. Tracking compliance measures our collective discipline about information security.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal B1.3a: Intentional Broadcasts & Interstellar Messages

**What to measure:**
- Number and power of intentional transmissions aimed at space
- Content of messages (are we revealing our technology level or civilization status?)
- Deliberate interstellar communication attempts
- Attempts to contact extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI-like broadcasts)

**Data sources:**
- Astronomical society records of interstellar messages
- SETI Institute and similar organizations' transmission records
- Space agency communication logs
- Radio station transmission records and power levels
- Government and military transmission logs (to extent available)

**Assessment framework:**
| Transmission Discipline | Status | Interpretation |
|------------------------|----|-----------------|
| No intentional interstellar broadcasts; transmissions disciplined | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization maintaining radio silence |
| Occasional intentional messages; limited power | 🟡 CAUTION | Some transmissions; growing communication attempts |
| Frequent deliberate broadcasts; high power; revealing technology | 🔴 CRITICAL | Clear, intentional signaling to universe |

**Frequency:** Annual audit; continuous incident logging for major broadcasts

### Signal B1.3d: Public Attitude & Institutional Discipline

**What to measure:**

- Research on collective decision-making

**Assessment framework:**
| Institutional Discipline | Status | Interpretation |
|--------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Strong institutional controls; public understands security risks | 🟢 NOMINAL | Civilization unified around stealth |
| Some pressure for transmission; controlled by policy | 🟡 CAUTION | Conflicting values; risks of unauthorized broadcasts |
| Weak institutional control; pressure to broadcast; unauthorized transmissions | 🔴 CRITICAL | Institutional breakdown on information security |

**Frequency:** Annual assessment; quarterly incident logging

## 4. Interpretation Guidance

### High Compliance (NOMINAL)
- **Meaning**: Civilization is maintaining radio discipline; transmissions are controlled
- **Implication**: We're not revealing ourselves through broadcasts
- **Action**: Maintain institutional discipline; protect against unauthorized transmissions

### Moderate Compliance (CAUTION)
- **Meaning**: Some transmissions are occurring; control is weakening
- **Implication**: We're at risk of revealing information through accumulation of signals
- **Actions**: 
  - Strengthen institutional controls on interstellar communication
  - Audit all external transmissions for security risk
  - Contain RF leakage through improved shielding
  - Reduce military RF emissions where possible
  - Educate public on risks of broadcasting
  - Establish formal decision process for any interstellar communication

### Low Compliance (CRITICAL)
- **Meaning**: Civilization is actively broadcasting; radio silence broken
- **Implication**: We have revealed our existence and/or technology level
- **Actions**: Trigger B1 emergency protocols
  - Immediate halt to all non-essential transmissions
  - Emergency RF shielding and containment
  - Preparation for external response
  - Unified global communication protocol
  - Contingency planning for detection and contact

## 5. Failure Modes & Limitations

### How This Indicator Could Be Misread

**False Positive Risk:**
- *Over-confidence in stealth*: Assuming undetected transmissions don't reveal us
- *Parochial focus*: Assuming military RF is only local concern when it's cosmic signal
- *Assuming compliance enforceability*: Radio discipline requires global coordination; easy to defect

**False Negative Risk:**
- *Hidden broadcasts*: Classified or unknown transmissions outside monitoring scope
- *Gradual norm drift*: Radio silence as value slowly erodes until suddenly broken
- *Cascading transmission*: Each additional broadcast makes previous broadcasts retroactively more dangerous

### How to Mitigate
1. **Multi-source verification**: Don't rely on single monitoring source
2. **Monitor global compliance**: Ensure discipline across all nations/factions
3. **Institutional memory**: Prevent erosion of radio silence as governing value
4. **Technological containment**: Engineer systems that cannot transmit without authorization
5. **Prepare for defection**: Assume someone will eventually try to broadcast

## 6. Connection to Response Protocols

This indicator directly triggers escalation to the following responses (see `30_responses/B_external_existential/`):

| Compliance Level | Primary Response | Escalation Path |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| > 0.9 (NOMINAL) | **B1.3a**: Maintain radio discipline protocols | Continue stealth posture |
| 0.6-0.9 (CAUTION) | **B1.3b**: Strengthen transmission controls | Emergency discipline enforcement |
| < 0.6 (CRITICAL) | **B1.3c**: Emergency transmission halt | Full Dark Forest response |

## 7. Related Indicators & Cross-Filter Links

### Complementary Indicators in B1 Category
- **B1.1 (Technosignature Detectability)**: Heat is unavoidable; transmissions are not
- **B1.2 (Anomaly Detection Threshold)**: Transmissions reveal us at lower thresholds than heat

### B-Filter Cross-Links
- **B2 (Berserker)**: Transmissions might signal intelligence milestones
- **B3 (Quarantine)**: Intentional messages reveal our intentionality and values
- **B4 (Simulation)**: Transmissions reveal what we're learning about physics/reality

### A-Filter Implications
- **A1 (Alignment)**: Aligned AI respects radio silence; misaligned AI broadcasts without permission
- **A2 (Cognitive Parasitism)**: Loss of human control makes transmission discipline harder
- **A4 (Replication)**: Escaped systems might broadcast to recruit or signal

*"Radio silence is the hardest law to enforce because it requires everyone not to do something they want to do. You maintain it by culture, by discipline, by the collective agreement that survival is more important than message. Break that culture once, and it breaks forever."*
