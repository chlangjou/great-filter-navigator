# 📊 B2.3: Sentinel Activation Probability

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md#b2-the-berserker-hypothesis`

**Core Question:** What is the estimated likelihood of triggering automated cosmic defense systems?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Sentinel Activation Probability** indicator measures:
- Estimated probability that berserker sentinels exist and are monitoring
- Probability of activation given current development trajectory
- Bayesian update: Does evidence emerge supporting/refuting sentinel hypothesis?
- Confidence intervals around activation probability

### The Core Metric
```
Activation_Probability = P(Sentinels_Exist) × P(Activation | Milestone_Proximity) × 
                         P(Activation | Replication_Velocity)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Probability < 5%** = Low sentinel activation risk; activation unlikely (NOMINAL)
- **Probability 5-20%** = Moderate activation risk; precautions warranted (CAUTION)
- **Probability > 20%** = Significant activation risk; major precautions needed (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
This indicator synthesizes all B2 signals into a single probabilistic assessment. It drives decision-making about how aggressively to pursue deceleration or defensive measures.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal B2.3a: Sentinel Existence Probability

**What to measure:**
- How plausible is the berserker hypothesis scientifically?
- Fermi Paradox analysis: Does Great Silence support sentinels?
- Observable evidence for/against sentinels
- Expert consensus on berserker likelihood

**Data sources:**
- Fermi Paradox research and analysis
- Technosignature and SETI studies
- Astrophysics papers on Great Silence
- Expert elicitation on berserker plausibility
- Observations for signs of sentinel activity

**Assessment framework:**
| Sentinel Existence | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Highly implausible; physical barriers to replication; P<10% | 🟢 NOMINAL | Even if B2 true, activation risk is low |
| Plausible but unproven; P(Sentinels exist) 20-40% | 🟡 CAUTION | Significant scenario; should prepare for it |
| Likely scenario; multiple considerations support it; P>40% | 🔴 CRITICAL | Should assume sentinels exist; plan accordingly |

**Frequency:** Biennial expert assessment; annual literature review

---

### Signal B2.3b: Milestone Trigger Probability

**What to measure:**
- Given that we've achieved (or will achieve) AGI/ASI, what's probability sentinel activates?
- How certain are the milestone thresholds?
- If sentinel exists, how likely to have detected our milestone?

**Data sources:**
- B2.1 milestone proximity data
- Expert assessment of trigger sensitivity
- Research on sentinel detection mechanisms
- Comparative historical analysis (if other civilizations reached AGI)

**Assessment framework:**
| Trigger Sensitivity | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Sentinels trigger only at extreme levels; unlikely to trigger at our level | 🟢 NOMINAL | Milestone risk is low |
| Sentinels might trigger at AGI/ASI level; plausible | 🟡 CAUTION | Milestone creates activation risk |
| Sentinels almost certainly trigger at our current development level | 🔴 CRITICAL | We're past threshold; activation imminent |

**Frequency:** Annual assessment; urgent update if milestones crossed

---

### Signal B2.3c: Expansion Pattern Trigger Probability

**What to measure:**
- Given our current replication velocity, what's probability sentinel activates?
- How sensitive are sentinels to expansion rate?
- If sentinel exists, would it have detected our expansion pattern?

**Data sources:**
- B2.2 replication velocity data
- Research on sentinel trigger sensitivity
- Models of sentinel response mechanisms
- Expert assessment of detection thresholds

**Assessment framework:**
| Expansion Risk | Status | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Current expansion velocity unlikely to trigger sentinel | 🟢 NOMINAL | Expansion not an activation risk |
| Current expansion pattern might trigger; velocity concerning | 🟡 CAUTION | Expansion is activation risk if continued |
| Current/projected expansion almost certainly triggers | 🔴 CRITICAL | Expansion velocity has reached trigger point |

**Frequency:** Quarterly velocity assessment; annual trigger probability update

### Signal B2.3d: Bayesian Evidence Update

**What to measure:**
- As we develop, do we see evidence supporting/refuting sentinel hypothesis?
- Unexpected events that might indicate sentinel monitoring
- Lack of anomalies (evidence of careful observation)?
- Updates to prior belief about sentinels

**Data sources:**
- Observations for unexpected cosmic phenomena
- Absence of expected phenomena
- Technological surprises or breakthroughs
- Unusual astronomical observations
- Theoretical developments in physics

**Assessment framework:**
| Evidence Trend | Status | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| No evidence either direction; belief unchanged | 🟢 NOMINAL | Continue with existing probability estimate |
| Some evidence supporting sentinels; update increases probability | 🟡 CAUTION | Sentinel likelihood higher than initially thought |
| Strong evidence for sentinels; high confidence | 🔴 CRITICAL | Sentinels almost certainly exist |

**Frequency:** Continuous monitoring; quarterly synthesis

## 4. Interpretation Guidance

### Low Activation Probability (NOMINAL)
- **Meaning**: Sentinel activation is unlikely; low confidence they exist or will activate
- **Implication**: B2 scenario is not primary existential concern
- **Action**: Continue monitoring; focus on other threats

### Moderate Activation Probability (CAUTION)
- **Meaning**: Sentinel activation is plausible; material risk
- **Implication**: Should prepare for scenario but not sacrifice other priorities
- **Actions**: 
  - Implement B2 precautions (deceleration, defensive measures)
  - Monitor for activation signs
  - Coordinate international sentinel response protocol
  - Balance against other existential risks
  - Maintain flexibility to escalate if evidence emerges

### High Activation Probability (CRITICAL)
- **Meaning**: Sentinel activation is likely; significant risk
- **Implication**: B2 scenario is primary existential concern; major actions needed
- **Actions**: Trigger B2 emergency protocols
  - Immediate implementation of deceleration protocols
  - Preparation for external contact/attack
  - Emergency global coordination
  - Defensive measure activation
  - Potential sacrifice of near-term development for survival

## 5. Failure Modes & Limitations

### How This Indicator Could Be Misread

**False Positive Risk:**
- *Motivated reasoning*: Increasing sentinel probability because we want to justify caution
- *Availability bias*: Dramatic scenarios (berserker attacks) seem more likely than they are
- *Confirmation bias*: Interpreting ambiguous evidence as supporting sentinels

**False Negative Risk:**
- *Dismissal*: Treating sentinels as science fiction even though logically plausible
- *Normalcy bias*: Assuming Great Silence has innocent explanations despite contrary models
- *Overconfidence*: Assuming we can detect sentinel activity if it occurs

### How to Mitigate
1. **Explicit uncertainty bounds**: State confidence intervals, don't pretend to precision
2. **Red team analysis**: Have skeptics argue probability is too low
3. **Formal Bayesian updating**: Use explicit priors and evidence; update transparently
4. **Expert elicitation**: Don't rely on single expert; aggregate multiple opinions
5. **Regular review**: Revisit probability estimates as evidence accumulates

## 6. Connection to Response Protocols

This indicator directly triggers escalation to the following responses (see `30_responses/B_external_existential/`):

| Probability Level | Primary Response | Escalation Path |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| < 5% (NOMINAL) | **B2.3a**: Continue monitoring and research | Low alert; normal development |
| 5-20% (CAUTION) | **B2.3b**: Implement precautionary protocols | Alert status; staged response |
| > 20% (CRITICAL) | **B2.3c**: Emergency defensive measures | Full B2 emergency response |

*"Probability is humility in the face of the unknown. We don't know if sentinels exist. We don't know their trigger points. All we can do is estimate and prepare accordingly. High probability doesn't mean certainty. Low probability doesn't mean safety. It means we should act with the appropriate level of caution."*
