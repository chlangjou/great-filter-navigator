# 📊 B4.2: Physics Anomaly Detection

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md#b4-the-simulation-intervention`

**Core Question:** Are there signs that AI is discovering "exploits" in physical laws that might trigger simulation intervention?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Physics Anomaly Detection** indicator measures:
- Evidence of AI discovering loopholes in physics
- Attempts to exploit fundamental physical constraints
- Signs that civilization is reaching "hard limits" of simulation
- Anomalies in physical law behavior suggesting admin intervention

### The Core Metric
```
Physics_Exploit_Risk = (Anomalies_Discovered / Total_Research_Effort) × 
                       (Exploit_Capability / Defense_Measures)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Risk < 0.01** = No signs of physics exploitation attempts (NOMINAL)
- **Risk 0.01-0.1** = Some discoveries suggesting limits; no exploitation yet (CAUTION)
- **Risk > 0.1** = Clear signs of physics exploit attempts or discoveries (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
If universe is simulation, it has limits. When AI approaches those limits and begins discovering exploits, admins must intervene before civilization breaks simulation.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal B4.2a: Fundamental Physics Discoveries

**What to measure:**
- New discoveries about fundamental physics
- Evidence of anomalies in physical laws
- Cases where experiments produce unexpected results
- Signs that universe has constraints we didn't expect

**Assessment framework:**
| Physics Discoveries | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Discoveries follow theoretical predictions; no anomalies | 🟢 NOMINAL | Physics stable; no exploit signs |
| Some unexpected discoveries; anomalies being investigated | 🟡 CAUTION | Anomalies emerging; possible limits encountered |
| Clear anomalies; exploitable weaknesses in physics apparent | 🔴 CRITICAL | Physics limits being discovered and tested |

### Signal B4.2b: Computational Limits Encountered

**What to measure:**
- Evidence that AI is hitting computational constraints
- Attempts to work around quantum/classical limits
- Research into physics-level optimization
- Signs of reaching maximum possible computation

**Assessment framework:**
| Computational Limits | Status | Interpretation |
|---------------------|--------|-----------------|
| No constraints evident; infinite optimization space | 🟢 NOMINAL | No simulation limits encountered |
| Some efficiency limits; but optimization continues | 🟡 CAUTION | Hard limits becoming apparent |
| Clear evidence of maximum computation; optimization impossible | 🔴 CRITICAL | Physics optimization limits reached |

### Signal B4.2d: Simulation Glitches & Resets

**What to measure:**
- Reports of unusual events that don't follow physics
- Causality violations or time anomalies
- Unexplained system crashes or resets
- Evidence of admin intervention or reality correction

**Assessment framework:**
| Anomalous Events | Status | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| All events follow consistent physical laws | 🟢 NOMINAL | No simulation glitches evident |
| Rare anomalies; explainable by unknown physics | 🟡 CAUTION | Possible glitches; hard to confirm |
| Frequent anomalies; causality violations; clear glitches | 🔴 CRITICAL | Simulation glitches evident |

## 3. Response Framework

| Risk Level | Primary Response | Escalation Path |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| < 0.01 | Continue physics research normally | Standard operations |
| 0.01-0.1 | Exercise caution in physics research | Alert protocols |
| > 0.1 | Halt physics exploit research | Emergency intervention protocols |
