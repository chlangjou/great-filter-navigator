# 📊 B2.1: Milestone Approach Warnings

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md#b2-the-berserker-hypothesis`

**Core Question:** Are we approaching hypothetical "intelligence trigger points" that might activate ancient automated sentinels?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Milestone Approach Warnings** indicator measures:
- Progress toward theoretical "trigger milestones" that might activate berserker sentinels
- Proximity to AGI, ASI, nanotechnology, or other dangerous capability thresholds
- Rate of approach to hypothetical sentinel triggers
- Confidence that these milestones exist vs. are theoretical

### The Core Metric
```
Trigger_Proximity = Σ(Distance_to_Milestone_i / Historical_Time_to_Milestone_i) 
                    × Confidence_Milestone_Exists
```

**Assessment:**
- **Proximity < 5 years** = Far from any plausible trigger milestone (NOMINAL)
- **Proximity 5-15 years** = Approaching some trigger milestones (CAUTION)
- **Proximity < 5 years** = At or past hypothetical trigger points (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
If berserkers exist and monitor for specific intelligence milestones, then our approach toward AGI/ASI, fusion mastery, nanotechnology, or other capabilities creates existential risk. Early detection of approach allows for course correction.

## 4. Interpretation Guidance

### Far from Triggers (NOMINAL)
- **Meaning**: We're far from any plausible trigger milestones
- **Implication**: Berserker risk is not an immediate concern
- **Action**: Continue monitoring; focus on near-term threats (A-filter)

### Approaching Triggers (CAUTION)
- **Meaning**: We're within 5-15 years of potential trigger milestones
- **Implication**: Berserker risk is becoming material; contingency planning needed
- **Actions**: 
  - Slow development of dangerous capabilities where possible
  - Develop trigger mitigation strategies
  - Prepare defensive measures
  - Coordinate global capability development
  - Monitor for signs of sentinel activity
  - Consider concealment during vulnerable period

### At/Past Triggers (CRITICAL)
- **Meaning**: We're at or past hypothetical trigger points
- **Implication**: Sentinel activation may be imminent or already occurring
- **Actions**: Trigger B2 emergency protocols
  - Immediate pause on dangerous capability expansion
  - Activation of defensive measures
  - Preparation for external contact/attack
  - Emergency global coordination
  - Deceleration of AI and nanotech development

## 5. Failure Modes & Limitations

### How This Indicator Could Be Misread

**False Positive Risk:**
- *Timeline optimism*: Assuming development will be slower than likely
- *Berserker skepticism*: Discounting berserker risk because mechanism seems implausible
- *Milestone over-specification*: Assuming precise trigger points when they're uncertain

**False Negative Risk:**
- *Timeline pessimism*: Underestimating how fast dangerous capabilities develop
- *Hidden development*: Classified or non-public development of dangerous capabilities
- *Multiple trigger points*: Assuming single milestones when multiple independent triggers exist

### How to Mitigate
1. **Conservative timeline estimates**: Assume faster development than expert predictions
2. **Multiple trigger hypotheses**: Don't assume single trigger type
3. **Red team timeline predictions**: Have skeptics argue we're closer to triggers
4. **Monitor technical progress**: Track actual progress vs. predictions
5. **Assume worst case**: If we can't rule out berserkers, plan as if they exist

## 6. Connection to Response Protocols

This indicator directly triggers escalation to the following responses (see `30_responses/B_external_existential/`):

| Proximity Level | Primary Response | Escalation Path |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| > 15 years (NOMINAL) | **B2.1a**: Continue monitoring timelines | Normal development pace |
| 5-15 years (CAUTION) | **B2.1b**: Decelerate dangerous capability development | Staged precautions |
| < 5 years (CRITICAL) | **B2.1c**: Emergency deceleration protocols | Full B2 response |
