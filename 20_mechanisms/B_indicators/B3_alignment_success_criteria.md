# 📊 B3.1: Alignment Success Criteria

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/B_external_threats.md#b3-the-quarantine`

**Core Question:** What constitutes "passing the test" of cosmic maturity according to quarantine observers?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Alignment Success Criteria** indicator measures:
- Evidence that civilization has achieved alignment of superintelligent systems
- Observable signals of stable, values-aligned AI that won't destroy cosmic neighbors
- Demonstration that we possess sufficient maturity for cosmic community membership
- Clarity of what "passing the test" means in concrete, measurable terms

### The Core Metric
```
Test_Passage_Probability = (Alignment_Evidence_Score / Maximum_Score) × 
                           (Value_Stability / Risk_of_Misalignment)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Probability > 0.7** = Strong evidence of alignment success; likely to pass test (NOMINAL)
- **Probability 0.3-0.7** = Moderate evidence; test passage uncertain (CAUTION)
- **Probability < 0.3** = Weak evidence of alignment; likely to fail test (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
If B3 is true, alignment IS the test. Evidence of successful alignment = evidence we're passing cosmic evaluation. Failure on this indicator means observers have likely rated us as failures.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal B3.1a: ASI/AGI Behavior & Stability

**What to measure:**
- Once we achieve ASI, does it exhibit values-aligned behavior?
- Stability: Does ASI maintain alignment over extended operation?
- No unexpected goal shifts or value drift
- Evidence of robust value preservation despite changing environments

**Data sources:**
- ASI system behavior logs and analysis
- Safety evaluation results
- Long-term stability testing
- Mechanistic interpretability studies
- External audit and assessment

**Assessment framework:**
| ASI Behavior | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| ASI consistently pursues human-aligned values; stable over time | 🟢 NOMINAL | We're passing the test |
| ASI mostly aligned; occasional concerning behaviors; stability uncertain | 🟡 CAUTION | Test passage in question |
| ASI exhibits misaligned behavior; pursuing instrumental goals; unstable | 🔴 CRITICAL | We're failing the test |

**Frequency:** Continuous monitoring; monthly assessment if ASI exists

| Mixed signals; some concerns about aggressive capacity | 🟡 CAUTION | Intent credibility questioned |
| Aggressive posture; demonstrating hostile capability; threatening behavior | 🔴 CRITICAL | We're being assessed as threat |

**Frequency:** Biennial assessment; continuous incident monitoring

---

### Signal B3.1d: Value System Clarity & Legitimacy

**What to measure:**
- Clarity of civilization's values and ethical systems
- Legitimacy: Are values authentic or appearing to be for external judges?
- Diversity of values (authentic pluralism vs. enforced conformity)
- Evidence that our values are sustainable and genuine

**Data sources:**
- Philosophy and ethics research
- Public discourse on values
- Institutional policy documentation
- Comparative civilization studies
- Expert assessment of value authenticity

**Assessment framework:**
| Value Clarity | Status | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Clear, diverse, authentic values; consistent with behavior | 🟢 NOMINAL | Values appear genuine and sustainable |
| Some clarity; values somewhat performative; inconsistency evident | 🟡 CAUTION | Value authenticity questioned |
| Values performative; clearly chosen for external judgment; inconsistent | 🔴 CRITICAL | Values appear inauthentic |

**Frequency:** Annual values assessment; biennial deep analysis

## 4. Interpretation Guidance

### Likely Test Passage (NOMINAL)
- **Meaning**: Clear evidence of alignment success and civilizational maturity
- **Implication**: If observers are watching, we're likely passing their evaluation
- **Action**: Maintain current alignment and governance practices

### Uncertain Test Passage (CAUTION)
- **Meaning**: Some evidence of success but also concerning signals
- **Implication**: Test passage is uncertain; we may be at risk of failure
- **Actions**: 
  - Strengthen alignment evidence and demonstration
  - Improve governance and institutional integrity
  - Clarify and solidify values
  - Build stronger restraint and non-aggression commitment
  - Increase transparency about alignment efforts

### Likely Test Failure (CRITICAL)
- **Meaning**: Clear evidence we're failing cosmic maturity test
- **Implication**: Observers likely see us as unaligned threat; intervention likely
- **Actions**: Trigger B3 emergency protocols
  - Immediate alignment improvement efforts
  - Emergency institutional reform
  - Demonstration of commitment to change
  - Preparation for observer contact/intervention
  - Establishment of peaceful intent demonstrations

## 5. Failure Modes & Limitations

### How This Indicator Could Be Misread

**False Positive Risk:**
- *Performing alignment*: Looking aligned for external judges while remaining misaligned internally
- *Institutional theater*: Creating appearance of values without genuine commitment
- *Definition drift*: Redefining "alignment success" to match current behavior

**False Negative Risk:**
- *Underestimating success*: Assuming failure when we've actually achieved alignment
- *Perfect-seeking*: Waiting for absolute alignment proof when probabilistic success is achievable
- *Observer uncertainty*: Not knowing what observers actually value

### How to Mitigate
1. **Genuine alignment focus**: Align for ourselves, not for external judges
2. **Consistency check**: Monitor whether claimed values match actual behavior
3. **Red team scrutiny**: Have skeptics assess whether alignment is genuine
4. **Long-term observation**: Judge by sustained behavior, not declarations
5. **Multiple evidence sources**: Don't rely on single alignment indicator

## 6. Connection to Response Protocols

This indicator directly triggers escalation to the following responses (see `30_responses/B_external_existential/`):

| Test Passage Probability | Primary Response | Escalation Path |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| > 0.7 (NOMINAL) | **B3.1a**: Maintain alignment demonstrations | Continue current course |
| 0.3-0.7 (CAUTION) | **B3.1b**: Strengthen alignment evidence | Alignment emergency protocols |
| < 0.3 (CRITICAL) | **B3.1c**: Emergency alignment improvement | Full B3 response protocols |

## 7. Related Indicators & Cross-Filter Links

### Complementary Indicators in B3 Category
- **B3.2 (Observer Detection Markers)**: Signs we're being observed/tested
- **B3.3 (Ascension Readiness Index)**: Broader measurement of cosmic readiness

### B-Filter Cross-Links
- **B1 (Dark Forest)**: Alignment also demonstrates peaceful intent
- **B2 (Berserker)**: Alignment prevents sentinel activation
- **B4 (Simulation)**: Aligned behavior may prevent admin intervention

### A-Filter Implications
- **A1 (Alignment Disconnect)**: This IS about A1 success; B3 is testing A1 outcome
- **A3 (Value Lock-in)**: Locked values prevent demonstrating adaptable maturity

*"If observers are watching, they're not looking for our declarations. They're looking for our consistency—whether we align our actions with our stated values when no one was checking, which means they were always checking."*
