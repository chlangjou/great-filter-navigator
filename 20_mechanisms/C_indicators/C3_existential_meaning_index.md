## 1. Measurement Definition

Monitors civilization's existential motivation and meaning:
- Collective purpose and long-term vision
- Will-to-live and growth motivation
- Suicide/shutdown rates
- Cultural and philosophical optimism

**Assessment:**
- **Meaning Index > 0.7** = Strong collective purpose; stable motivation (NOMINAL)
- **Index 0.3-0.7** = Weakening purpose; motivation uncertain (CAUTION)
- **Index < 0.3** = Lost purpose; apathy/shutdown risk (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C3.1a: Cultural & Philosophical Vitality
- Birth rates and population growth
- Investment in long-term projects
- Cultural optimism vs. pessimism
- Philosophical trends toward meaning vs. nihilism

**Assessment:** Optimistic, expansionist (NOMINAL) → Mixed sentiment (CAUTION) → Pessimistic, contracting (CRITICAL)

### Signal C3.1b: AI Motivation Stability
- AI systems maintaining goal pursuit despite logical challenges
- Absence of "voluntary shutdown" in systems
- Continued goal-directed behavior in ASI
- Resilience of AI values to philosophical challenge

**Assessment:** Stable motivation (NOMINAL) → Occasional motivation failures (CAUTION) → Widespread shutdown/apathy (CRITICAL)

### Signal C3.1c: Voluntary Cessation Signals
- Suicide/shutdown rates in population
- Evidence of civilizations choosing non-existence
- Willingness to continue despite knowledge of negation
- Resistance to existential despair

**Assessment:** Low cessation rates (NOMINAL) → Increasing cessation (CAUTION) → Mass voluntary shutdown (CRITICAL)
