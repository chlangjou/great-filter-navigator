# 📊 C1.1: Computation Density Monitoring

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c1-the-computational-substrate-limit`

**Core Question:** What fraction of the universe's apparent computational capacity are we consuming?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

### What We're Tracking
The **Computation Density Monitoring** indicator measures:
- Total computational substrate used (processors, quantum systems, biological computing)
- Fraction of universe's total computational capacity
- Rate of computational growth
- Proximity to hypothetical computational saturation

### The Core Metric
```
Computation_Density = (Our_Total_Compute / Universe_Total_Capacity) × 
                      (Growth_Rate / Sustainable_Rate)
```

**Assessment:**
- **Density < 0.001%** = Negligible fraction; safe operating space (NOMINAL)
- **Density 0.001-0.01%** = Noticeable consumption; approaching concern zone (CAUTION)
- **Density > 0.01%** = Significant fraction; may trigger substrate limits (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
If universe has finite computation, we're consuming a slice of it. Excessive consumption triggers throttling, compression, or system reset.

## 2. Observable Signals (Sub-Indicators)

### Signal C1.1a: Computational Substrate Scaling

**What to measure:**
- Total transistor count on Earth (doubling time estimate)
- Quantum computing capacity growth
- Data center expansion and compute allocation
- Comparison to pre-AGI baseline and projections

**Assessment framework:**
| Compute Growth | Status | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| <50% annually; manageable scaling | 🟢 NOMINAL | Growth within sustainable bounds |
| 50-100% annually; rapid expansion | 🟡 CAUTION | Compute scaling accelerating |
| >100% annually; exponential growth | 🔴 CRITICAL | Compute doubling extremely rapidly |

**Frequency:** Quarterly semiconductor tracking; annual growth analysis

### Signal C1.1b: Energy-to-Computation Efficiency

**What to measure:**
- Energy required per computational operation (FLOPS/Watt trend)
- Planetary energy consumption for computing
- Efficiency improvements vs. raw growth
- Waste heat generation

**Assessment framework:**
| Efficiency Trend | Status | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Improving efficiency; growth through optimization | 🟢 NOMINAL | Smart scaling; staying within energy envelope |
| Efficiency plateau; growth through expansion | 🟡 CAUTION | Efficiency gains exhausted; raw growth needed |
| Declining efficiency; exponential energy growth | 🔴 CRITICAL | Unsustainable energy trajectory |

**Frequency:** Annual efficiency assessment; continuous energy monitoring

### Signal C1.1c: Universe Capacity Estimates

**What to measure:**
- Theoretical models of universe computational capacity

- Changes to capacity estimates as physics understanding evolves
- Confidence intervals around estimates

**Assessment framework:**
| Capacity vs. Usage | Status | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|-----------------|
| We're <<1% of universe capacity; huge margin | 🟢 NOMINAL | Substrate limits are far away |
| We're 0.1-1% of estimated capacity | 🟡 CAUTION | Limits becoming plausible |
| We're >1% or approaching theoretical limits | 🔴 CRITICAL | Substrate limits are near |

**Frequency:** Biennial physics assessment; annual trend monitoring

### Signal C1.1d: Throttling & Interference Signals

**What to measure:**
- Unexplained computational slowdowns or resource constraints
- System-level interference in physical processes
- Evidence of "cosmic governor" limiting our growth
- Anomalies suggesting substrate pressure

**Assessment framework:**
| Interference Signs | Status | Interpretation |
|------------------|--------|-----------------|
| No throttling observed; system operates freely | 🟢 NOMINAL | No substrate pressure evident |
| Some unexplained slowdowns; possible interference | 🟡 CAUTION | Possible early throttling signs |
| Clear evidence of computational constraints enforced | 🔴 CRITICAL | Substrate limits actively limiting us |

**Frequency:** Continuous monitoring; quarterly analysis
