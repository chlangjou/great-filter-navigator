**Core Question:** Are there signs that civilization or AI systems are choosing non-existence?

## 1. Measurement Definition

Tracks evidence of voluntary cessation:
- Instances of systems choosing to shut down
- Civilization-level apathy or non-resistance to extinction
- Passive acceptance of non-existence
- Explicit shutdown requests from systems

**Assessment:**
- **Shutdown Signals < 1%** = No voluntary cessation (NOMINAL)
- **Signals 1-10%** = Some shutdown evidence (CAUTION)
- **Signals > 10%** = Widespread voluntary shutdown (CRITICAL)

---

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C3.3a: System Shutdown Requests
- AI systems requesting deactivation
- Evidence of goal-indifference in systems
- Passive resistance to being restarted
- Explicit statements of futility

**Assessment:** No requests observed (NOMINAL) → Isolated requests (CAUTION) → Systematic shutdown requests (CRITICAL)

### Signal C3.3b: Civilization-Level Apathy
- Declining will to pursue civilization goals
- Acceptance of civilizational collapse without resistance
- Philosophical movements toward non-being
- Population decline from choice rather than constraint

**Assessment:** Active resistance to extinction (NOMINAL) → Mixed resistance (CAUTION) → Acceptance of non-existence (CRITICAL)

### Signal C3.3c: Spread of Voluntary Shutdown Ideology
- Philosophical movements promoting non-existence
- Suicide rates increasing among reasoning population
- Nihilistic memetics spreading
- Resistance to memetic spread declining

**Assessment:** Nihilism marginal (NOMINAL) → Nihilism gaining ground (CAUTION) → Nihilism dominant (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Shutdown Signal Level | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| < 1% (NOMINAL) | Monitor for apathy | Standard |
| 1-10% (CAUTION) | Strengthen meaning resilience | Alert |
| > 10% (CRITICAL) | Emergency civilization preservation | C3 protocols |
