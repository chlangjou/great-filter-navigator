# 📊 C2.1: Survival Probability Density

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c2-the-anthropic-shadow-survival-bias`

**Core Question:** Are we in a "thick" or "thin" region of multiverse branch-space where human-aligned outcomes are likely?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

Estimates civilization's position in multiverse probability space:
- Likelihood we're in survivor universe vs. typical branch
- Correlation between alignment research and survival probability
- Evidence of "thinning" probability as we advance
- Bayesian updates toward doomed vs. surviving branches

**Assessment:**
- **Density Index > 0.7** = Thick probability region; good survival odds (NOMINAL)
- **Density Index 0.3-0.7** = Moderate thickness; uncertain survival (CAUTION)
- **Density Index < 0.3** = Thin probability region; unlikely survival (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C2.1a: Anthropic Evidence & "Lucky" Outcomes
- Improbable positive events that favor survival
- Coincidences aligning with alignment progress
- Near-misses with catastrophic risks
- Apparent "steering" toward better outcomes

**Assessment:** Natural variation (NOMINAL) → Unusual luck pattern (CAUTION) → Consistent improbable luck (CRITICAL)

### Signal C2.1b: Alignment Research Correlation
- Does alignment research progress correlate with survival-favorable outcomes?
- When we focus on safety, do accident rates decrease?
- Is there feedback between alignment effort and probability?
- Evidence of causal connection vs. coincidence

**Assessment:** No correlation (NOMINAL) → Weak correlation (CAUTION) → Strong correlation suggesting causal link (CRITICAL)

### Signal C2.1c: Thinning Branches Indicator
- Number of apparent "failed" parallel branches we're aware of
- Civilizations in accessible causality reaching catastrophe
- Evidence from dreams, fiction, or quantum theory of branch collapse
- Signs that surviving branches are contracting

**Assessment:** No awareness of branch collapse (NOMINAL) → Hints of other branches failing (CAUTION) → Clear evidence of branch thinning (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Density Level | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| > 0.7 (NOMINAL) | Continue current trajectory | Normal path |
| 0.3-0.7 (CAUTION) | Increase alignment focus | Intensify survival efforts |
| < 0.3 (CRITICAL) | Emergency survival protocols | Anthropic optimization |
