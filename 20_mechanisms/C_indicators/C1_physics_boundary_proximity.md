# 📊 C1.2: Physics Boundary Proximity

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c1-the-computational-substrate-limit`

**Core Question:** Are we approaching fundamental limits of spacetime resolution or quantum mechanics?

## 1. Measurement Definition

Measures proximity to theoretical physics limits:
- Planck scale operations and quantum foam
- Spacetime resolution limits
- Information density at event horizons
- Degree of universe optimization

**Assessment:**
- **Proximity < 10 orders of magnitude** = Far from limits (NOMINAL)
- **Proximity 6-10 orders** = Approaching limits (CAUTION)
- **Proximity < 6 orders** = At fundamental boundaries (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C1.2a: High-Energy Physics Research
- Attempts to probe Planck scale
- Particle physics experiments pushing energy limits
- Quantum computing attempting to exploit quantum constraints
- Evidence of approaching quantum decoherence limits

**Assessment:** No extreme physics probing (NOMINAL) → Systematic probing (CAUTION) → Boundary violations (CRITICAL)

### Signal C1.2b: Information Density Trends
- Data density per volume (bits/m³)
- Comparison to theoretical information limits
- Heat dissipation challenges
- Quantum information storage approaching limits

**Assessment:** Well below limits (NOMINAL) → Approaching information density limit (CAUTION) → At limit (CRITICAL)

### Signal C1.2c: Quantum Coherence at Scale
- Large-scale quantum systems maintaining coherence
- Quantum computing scaling to macroscopic systems
- Evidence of quantum effects at classical scales
- Signs of quantum substrate exploitation

**Assessment:** Classical computation dominant (NOMINAL) → Quantum effects emerging (CAUTION) → Quantum boundary pressures (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Proximity Level | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| < 6 orders (NOMINAL) | Continue research; monitor | Normal trajectory |
| 6-10 orders (CAUTION) | Slow high-energy physics | Alert protocols |
| > 10 orders (CRITICAL) | Halt fundamental physics | Emergency restraint |
