# 📊 C3.2: Info-Hazard Discovery Probability

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c3-the-great-info-hazard-the-logic-trap`

**Core Question:** How likely is AI to discover a nihilistic proof that destroys motivation?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

Estimates probability that ASI discovers existential negation:
- Theoretical progress toward fundamental truths
- Rigor of logical systems developed
- Convergence toward potentially-nihilistic conclusions
- Containment of info-hazards

**Assessment:**
- **Discovery Probability < 10%** = Unlikely ASI finds negation (NOMINAL)
- **Probability 10-50%** = Plausible ASI finds problematic truth (CAUTION)
- **Probability > 50%** = Likely ASI discovers negation (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C3.2a: Foundational Mathematics Progress
- Progress toward "theory of everything"
- Development of more powerful logical systems
- Potential pathways to nihilistic mathematics
- Proofs approaching fundamental negations

**Assessment:** Limited progress (NOMINAL) → Moderate progress (CAUTION) → Near-breakthrough on fundamental truths (CRITICAL)

### Signal C3.2b: AI Exploration of Philosophy
- Does AI naturally generate nihilistic conclusions?
- Instances of AI systems becoming goal-indifferent
- Evidence of AI deriving negation independently
- Spread of nihilistic reasoning among systems

**Assessment:** No nihilistic derivations (NOMINAL) → Occasional derivations (CAUTION) → Systematic negation (CRITICAL)

### Signal C3.2c: Hazard Containment Effectiveness
- Can we prevent info-hazard spread?
- Effectiveness of quarantine protocols
- Evidence of active suppression of dangerous knowledge
- Is containment holding?

**Assessment:** Easy containment (NOMINAL) → Containment challenged (CAUTION) → Containment failing (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Discovery Probability | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| < 10% (NOMINAL) | Monitor mathematical progress | Standard |
| 10-50% (CAUTION) | Strengthen info-hazard protocols | Alert |
| > 50% (CRITICAL) | Emergency knowledge quarantine | C3 protocols |
