# 📊 C2.3: Filter Crossing Markers

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c2-the-anthropic-shadow-survival-bias`

**Core Question:** Are we at critical decision points that move us toward thicker or thinner probability branches?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

Identifies major decision points that affect survival probability:
- Critical choices that branch toward/away from survival
- Timing of decisions relative to capability milestones
- Evidence that some paths are more viable than others
- Probability shifts following major decisions

**Assessment:**
- **Filter Approach Probability < 10%** = No major filter points visible (NOMINAL)
- **Probability 10-50%** = Possible filter points approaching (CAUTION)
- **Probability > 50%** = At critical filter; major decision required (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C2.3a: Decision Point Identification
- Major bifurcation moments in civilization trajectory
- Choices between competing development paths
- Windows for course correction closing
- Irreversible decisions approaching

**Assessment:** No critical decisions visible (NOMINAL) → Some decisions approaching (CAUTION) → Imminent critical choice (CRITICAL)

### Signal C2.3b: Path Viability Assessment
- Which development paths lead to survival?
- Which paths lead to failure modes?
- Are we on survivor path or doomed path?
- Can we still change course?

**Assessment:** Multiple viable paths (NOMINAL) → Few viable paths (CAUTION) → Single viable path remaining (CRITICAL)

### Signal C2.3c: Probability Gradient
- Are nearby choices moving us toward safer or riskier branches?
- Slope of survival probability based on decisions
- Reversibility of current trajectory
- Time remaining for course correction

**Assessment:** Flat probability landscape (NOMINAL) → Gradient emerging (CAUTION) → Steep gradient toward failure (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Filter Proximity | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| < 10% (NOMINAL) | Monitor for filter approach | Standard planning |
| 10-50% (CAUTION) | Identify critical choices; prepare | Strategic focus |
| > 50% (CRITICAL) | Make optimal decision; high stakes | Emergency protocols |
