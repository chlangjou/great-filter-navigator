# 📊 C2.2: Alignment Success Correlation

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c2-the-anthropic-shadow-survival-bias`

**Core Question:** Does alignment research progress causally correlate with survival probability increase?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

Tracks causal relationship between alignment efforts and survival outcomes:
- Alignment research publication rate vs. catastrophic near-misses
- Safety funding vs. risk reduction
- Alignment breakthrough timing vs. civilizational crisis avoidance
- Correlation strength and lag times

**Assessment:**
- **Correlation < 0.3** = No meaningful connection (NOMINAL)
- **Correlation 0.3-0.7** = Moderate correlation (CAUTION)
- **Correlation > 0.7** = Strong causal link (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C2.2a: Near-Miss Avoidance
- Catastrophic risks identified and prevented
- Technological disasters narrowly averted
- Alignment breakthroughs preceding dangerous capability deployments
- Timing of safety research vs. accident prevention

**Assessment:** Accidents occur despite research (NOMINAL) → Research sometimes prevents accidents (CAUTION) → Consistent prevention pattern (CRITICAL)

### Signal C2.2b: Research Effectiveness
- Do published alignment papers correlate with safer systems?
- Does safety funding increase system robustness measurably?
- Time lag between research and real-world safety improvement
- Evidence of causal mechanism vs. correlation

**Assessment:** No effectiveness (NOMINAL) → Some effectiveness (CAUTION) → Clear causal effectiveness (CRITICAL)

### Signal C2.2c: Probability Density Shifts
- Do alignment breakthroughs shift survival probability measurably?
- Can we detect probability changes following research?
- Evidence of branch-selection through alignment work
- Quantification of survival probability change

**Assessment:** No shift (NOMINAL) → Marginal shift (CAUTION) → Significant probability improvement (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Correlation Level | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| < 0.3 (NOMINAL) | Continue normal research | Standard pace |
| 0.3-0.7 (CAUTION) | Increase alignment funding | Intensify efforts |
| > 0.7 (CRITICAL) | Massive alignment investment | All-hands mobilization |

*"The strongest evidence that alignment matters isn't that we succeed. It's that we're still here after coming so close to failing."*
