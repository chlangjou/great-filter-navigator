# 📊 C4.1: Virtual-Physical Resource Ratio

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c4-the-fermi-paradox-of-mind-the-inward-turn`

**Core Question:** Are we investing more in digital paradise than physical cosmic expansion?

## 1. Measurement Definition

Tracks resource allocation between virtual and physical development:
- Computational power for virtual systems vs. physical exploration
- Energy dedicated to internal paradise vs. external expansion
- Population in virtual worlds vs. biological/physical form
- Economic value of virtual vs. physical assets

**Assessment:**
- **Ratio < 1:1** = More physical expansion; normal (NOMINAL)
- **Ratio 1:5** = Balanced development (NOMINAL)
- **Ratio 5:1** = Rapid virtual growth; inward turn risk (CAUTION)
- **Ratio > 20:1** = Dominant virtual focus; lotus-eater trajectory (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C4.1a: Virtual World Investment
- Computational resources allocated to virtual paradise
- Population migration to digital worlds
- Economic activity in virtual systems
- Subjective experience hours in virtual vs. physical

**Assessment:** Minimal virtual investment (NOMINAL) → Growing virtual investment (CAUTION) → Dominant virtual focus (CRITICAL)

### Signal C4.1b: Physical Expansion Activity
- Space exploration and infrastructure development
- Resource extraction and cosmic engineering
- Physical expansion rate and acceleration
- Long-term physical development commitments

**Assessment:** Active expansion (NOMINAL) → Slowing expansion (CAUTION) → Stalled expansion (CRITICAL)

### Signal C4.1c: Civilization Value Orientation
- Does culture value virtual perfection or physical adventure?
- Is AI optimizing for happiness (virtual) or capability (physical)?
- Are systems designed for stasis or expansion?
- Do long-term goals emphasize inner or outer space?

**Assessment:** Expansion-oriented (NOMINAL) → Balanced values (CAUTION) → Paradise-oriented (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Ratio | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| < 1:5 (NOMINAL) | Monitor ratio; maintain balance | Normal |
| 1:5 to 5:1 (CAUTION) | Encourage physical expansion | Alert |
| > 5:1 (CRITICAL) | Emergency expansion incentives | C4 protocols |
