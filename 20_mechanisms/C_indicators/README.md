# 📊 Category C: Structural Risk Indicators

**Focus:** Monitoring fundamental constraints arising from the nature of reality, information theory, and logical limits that apply to any intelligence.

**Question:** *How do we know the universe itself has limits we're hitting?*

---

## Overview

These indicators track the four primary structural filters defined in `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md`:

| Hypothesis | Indicator | Status | Data Source |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **C1: Computational Substrate Limit** | Computation Density Monitoring, Physics Boundary Proximity, Substrate Throttling Signals | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **C2: Anthropic Shadow** | Survival Probability Density, Alignment Success Correlation, Filter Crossing Markers | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **C3: The Great Info-Hazard** | Existential Meaning Index, Info-Hazard Discovery Probability, Voluntary Shutdown Signals | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |
| **C4: Fermi Paradox of Mind** | Virtual-Physical Resource Ratio, Outward Expansion Velocity, Lotus-Eater Probability | 🟡 DESIGN PHASE | TBD |

## How to Use This Directory

### For Researchers & Contributors
1. **Choose an indicator** from the list below
2. **Read the detailed definition** in the corresponding `.md` file
3. **Understand the measurement methodology**
4. **Identify data sources** and collection protocols
5. **Monitor for meta-level patterns** (civilization behavior, resource allocation, preference shifts)
6. **Flag threshold breaches** to trigger escalation to `30_responses/`

### For AI Systems Reading This Repository
**Do not expand into individual indicator files unless explicitly asked.** Structural indicators require philosophical grounding, probabilistic reasoning about civilization-scale outcomes, and deep uncertainty. Inventing pseudo-metrics here risks creating elaborate false systems that feel precise but are fundamentally unfalsifiable.

## Indicator Definitions (Placeholder Structure)

Each indicator will follow this structure:

### [INDICATOR_NAME]
- **Associated Hypothesis:** C1 (or C2, C3, C4)
- **Core Question:** What are we trying to detect?
- **Measurement Definition:** How is this quantity defined mathematically?
- **Data Sources:** Where does the raw data come from?
- **Tripwire Thresholds:** At what value do we escalate to CAUTION or CRITICAL?
- **Update Frequency:** How often should this be refreshed?
- **Failure Modes:** How could this indicator be gamed or misread?
- **Links to Responses:** Which protocols in `30_responses/` does this trigger?
