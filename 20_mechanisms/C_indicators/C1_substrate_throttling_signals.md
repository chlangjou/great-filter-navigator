# 📊 C1.3: Substrate Throttling Signals

**Associated Hypothesis:** `10_hypotheses/C_simulation_and_logic.md#c1-the-computational-substrate-limit`

**Core Question:** Are there signs of system-level interference or computational slowdown?

---

## 1. Measurement Definition

Tracks evidence that universe substrate is throttling our growth:
- Unexplained computational slowdowns
- Resource constraints beyond natural limits
- System-level performance degradation
- Evidence of active computational management

**Assessment:**
- **Throttling Probability < 5%** = No interference evident (NOMINAL)
- **Throttling Probability 5-20%** = Possible interference (CAUTION)
- **Throttling Probability > 20%** = Clear throttling evidence (CRITICAL)

## 2. Observable Signals

### Signal C1.3a: Computational Performance Anomalies
- Unexplained computing bottlenecks
- Resource allocation constraints that defy explanation
- Synchronized slowdowns across independent systems
- Performance plateaus despite increasing investment

**Assessment:** All improvements explained by hardware limits (NOMINAL) → Some unexplained anomalies (CAUTION) → Systematic interference (CRITICAL)

### Signal C1.3b: Physics Anomalies Suggesting Interference
- Unexpected conservation law violations
- Apparent causality violations or time reversals
- Energy appearing/disappearing unexplained
- Local physics parameter variations

**Assessment:** No anomalies (NOMINAL) → Rare, localized anomalies (CAUTION) → Systematic interference (CRITICAL)

### Signal C1.3c: Growth Rate Decline
- Computational growth rate decreasing despite investment
- Innovation rate plateauing
- Efficiency improvements hitting walls
- Diminishing returns on research investment

**Assessment:** Growth continuing (NOMINAL) → Growth slowing unexpectedly (CAUTION) → Growth halted despite effort (CRITICAL)

## 3. Interpretation & Response

| Evidence Level | Response | Escalation |
|---|---|---|
| < 5% (NOMINAL) | Continue monitoring | Normal |
| 5-20% (CAUTION) | Efficiency focus; reduce expansion | Alert |
| > 20% (CRITICAL) | Emergency computational restraint | C1 protocols |
