# 🧭 The Horizon: Project Backlog & Open Questions

> "To navigate the unknown, we must first map the edges of our ignorance."

This directory serves as the **buffer zone and research incubator** for the Great Filter Navigator. It captures ideas, contradictions, and research gaps that are not yet mature enough for the primary directories but are essential for the project's epistemic integrity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Backlog

1. **Identify Epistemic Gaps:** Documenting "known unknowns" to prevent a false sense of security in our current maps.
2. **Preserve Reasoning Trails:** Recording early-stage thoughts and alternative views that might be revised or expanded later.
3. **Manage Contradictions:** Explicitly tracking where different hypotheses or models conflict, rather than smoothing over them.
4. **Community/AI Entry Point:** Providing a low-friction space for external researchers (and AI agents) to propose new directions or critiques.

## 📂 Categorization of Backlog Items

Items in this directory are typically organized into the following areas:

### 1. Research Gaps (`RESEARCH_DEBT.md`)
Identified weaknesses in our current logic or areas where we lack empirical data. 
* *Example:* "Need more rigorous metrics for measuring recursive self-improvement speeds in decentralized AI models."

### 2. Contradiction Log (`CONTRADICTION_LOG.md`)
Tracking scenarios where a response to one filter (e.g., A1) might inadvertently trigger another filter (e.g., B1).
* *Focus:* Managing the trade-offs between "Stealth" and "Rapid Capability Growth."

### 3. Ideas Sandbox (`IDEAS_SANDBOX.md`)
High-uncertainty "Alternative Thinking" or "Out-there" hypotheses that require more formalization before moving to `/10_hypotheses/`.

### 4. Contribution Requests (`HELP_WANTED.md`)
Specific calls for expertise, mathematical modeling, or historical analysis to help move a backlog item into a primary folder.

## 🔄 The Maturation Process

How does an item move from **Backlog** to **Active Navigation**?

1. **Drafting:** An entry starts as a brief note or a list
