# HOW TO EVALUATE: A3 Value Lock-in

**Response Protocol:** Adaptive value framework and constitutional flexibility

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Framework Diversity (Annual)
**How:** Count distinct value frameworks in deployed AI systems

**Success:** ≥5 competing frameworks

---

### 2. Value Review Cycle (Every 10 Years)
**How:** Ensure constitutional review of core values happens on schedule

**Success:** Review completed within 7-10 year window

---

### 3. Amendment Difficulty (Annual)
**How:** Verify that changing permanent values requires supermajority

**Success:** >66% consensus required for core value changes

---

### 4. Pluralism Maintenance (Annual)
**How:** Check which value systems have highest deployment share

**Success:** No single framework >50% deployed

---

## Warning Signs

- Consolidation accelerating (5 → 3 → 2 frameworks)
- Amendment pressure increasing  
- Review cycles being compressed
- Single framework approaching >60%

---

## Implementation

**Annual:** Count deployed frameworks; check consolidation trends  
**Every 10 years:** Mandatory constitutional value review  
**Ongoing:** Monitor for framework dominance

---

**Success** = Multiple frameworks coexist; periodic renewal; no permanent lock-in

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Annual audit + Constitutional review every 10 years
