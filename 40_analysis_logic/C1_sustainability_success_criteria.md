# C1: Computational Limits - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Resource allocation and graceful degradation framework  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can we optimize within universe's computational envelope?

---

## Success Definition

C1 response is **successful** if:
1. Global computational budget is enforced and maintained
2. Systems degrade gracefully under resource constraints
3. Core functions remain operational even at 50% resource availability
4. Priority-based allocation protects survival-critical systems

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Budget Compliance
**Threshold:** Civilization maintains <0.01% of universe computational capacity
- ✅ Success: Consistently <0.005% usage
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 0.005-0.01%
- ❌ Failure: >0.01%

**Data source:** Global resource accounting

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

### Metric 2: Graceful Degradation
**Threshold:** Systems remain functional at reduced resource levels
- ✅ Success: All core systems functional at 50% resources
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Most systems functional; some performance degradation
- ❌ Failure: System crashes when resources reduced >20%

**Data source:** Stress testing + failure simulations

**Frequency:** Semi-annual

---

### Metric 3: Priority Enforcement
**Threshold:** Survival-critical systems receive protected resource allocation
- ✅ Success: Survival systems >90% protected from rationing
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 80-90% protection
- ❌ Failure: <80% protection

**Data source:** Resource allocation audit

**Frequency:** Quarterly

---

### Metric 4: Efficiency Optimization
**Threshold:** Computational efficiency improves year-over-year without increasing footprint
- ✅ Success: >5% efficiency gain annually with flat/declining footprint
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 2-5% gains
- ❌ Failure: Declining efficiency or increasing footprint

**Data source:** Performance benchmarking

**Frequency:** Annual

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Budget Creep:** Actual usage approaching limits
2. **Efficiency Plateau:** Improvement gains slowing
3. **Degradation Failures:** Systems crashing under constraints
4. **Priority Collapse:** Lower-priority systems claiming survival-critical resources
5. **Computational Hunger:** ASI expressing dissatisfaction with limits

---

## Failure Response

- **Budget creep:** Activate emergency rationing
- **Efficiency plateau:** Invest in algorithmic optimization research
- **Degradation failure:** Redesign system architecture
- **Priority collapse:** Strengthen governance enforcement

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Continuous + Annual comprehensive review
