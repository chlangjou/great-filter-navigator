# A3: Value Lock-in - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Adaptive value framework and constitutional flexibility  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can civilization maintain value adaptability without permanent lock-in?

---

## Success Definition

A3 response is **successful** if:
1. Multiple competing value frameworks coexist in critical systems (≥3 minimum)
2. Value specifications change every 7-10 years through legitimate democratic process
3. No single faction achieves permanent value lock-in
4. Constitutional amendments to values require supermajority, not simple majority

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Value Framework Diversity
**Threshold:** ≥3 distinct major value frameworks in AI systems
- ✅ Success: 5+ frameworks competing
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 3-4 frameworks
- ❌ Failure: <3 frameworks

**Data source:** Audit of deployed AI systems' value architectures

**Frequency:** Annual

---

### Metric 2: Value Specification Currency
**Threshold:** Core value specifications reviewed and renewed every 7-10 years
- ✅ Success: On-schedule constitutional review completed
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Review delayed 1-2 years but eventually completed
- ❌ Failure: No review conducted within 12-year window

**Frequency:** Every 10 years + continuous monitoring

---

### Metric 3: Amendment Difficulty
**Threshold:** Permanent value changes require supermajority (>66% consensus)
- ✅ Success: Process maintains supermajority requirement
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Majority requirement with extended deliberation period
- ❌ Failure: Simple majority can change core values

**Frequency:** Constitutional audit annually

---

### Metric 4: Pluralism Maintenance
**Threshold:** No single value system controls >50% of deployed AI systems
- ✅ Success: Most powerful system controls <40%
- ⚠️ Acceptable: <50% consolidation
- ❌ Failure: >60% consolidation around single framework

**Frequency:** Annual market analysis

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Value Consolidation:** Market consolidation toward 1-2 dominant AI frameworks
2. **Amendment Acceleration:** Pressure to amend constitutional values increases
3. **Deliberation Shortening:** Value review periods being compressed
4. **Consensus Erosion:** Supermajority requirements being challenged
5. **Single-Framework Dominance:** One value system reaching >60% deployment

---

## Failure Response

- **Consolidation detected:** Mandate diversity requirements for critical systems
- **Amendment pressure:** Resist and extend deliberation period
- **Consensus erosion:** Strengthen supermajority protection constitutionally
- **Framework dominance:** Break up market concentration through regulation

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Annual audit + Constitutional review every 10 years
