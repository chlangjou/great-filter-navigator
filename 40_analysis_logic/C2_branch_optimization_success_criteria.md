# C2: Anthropic Shadow - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Probability branch optimization and survival density maximization  
**Evaluation Focus:** Are we shifting toward higher-probability survival branches?

---

## Success Definition

C2 response is **successful** if:
1. Civilization experiences sustained focus on alignment and coordination work
2. Major existential risks are addressed systematically rather than reactively
3. Global coordination improves measurably (vs. fragmented geopolitical behavior)
4. "Lucky escapes" from existential threats decline or become less improbable

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Research Investment in Alignment
**Threshold:** Alignment research receives increasing fraction of AI research budget
- ✅ Success: 5%+ of total AI R&D budget → alignment
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 2-5%
- ❌ Failure: <2%

**Data source:** Funding tracking + institutional surveys

**Frequency:** Annual

---

### Metric 2: International Coordination Strength
**Threshold:** Major nations maintain cooperative agreements on existential risk
- ✅ Success: 180+ nations in formal coordination bodies
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 150-180 nations
- ❌ Failure: <150 nations

**Data source:** Treaty tracking + institutional participation

**Frequency:** Annual

---

### Metric 3: Existential Risk Preparation
**Threshold:** Civilization develops explicit response protocols for known threats
- ✅ Success: 12+ Great Filter responses fully articulated and tested
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 8-12 responses developed
- ❌ Failure: <8 responses

**Data source:** Framework documentation (GFN itself!)

**Frequency:** Annual review

---

### Metric 4: Improbability Index
**Threshold:** Measure whether "lucky escapes" from extinction are statistically improbable
- ✅ Success: Escape probability remains within normal statistical range
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Borderline improbability (no more than 1-2 sigma outliers)
- ❌ Failure: Multiple >3 sigma improbable escapes (indicates thin branch)

**Data source:** Post-incident analysis + near-miss tracking

**Frequency:** Annual statistical review

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Coordination Decline:** International agreements weakening
2. **Research Defunding:** Alignment research losing support
3. **Near-Miss Clustering:** Multiple improbable safety escapes in short period
4. **Morale Collapse:** Public losing belief in civilization's survival
5. **Decision Paralysis:** Unable to coordinate on critical choices

---

## Failure Response

- **Coordination decline:** Emergency summit to restore agreements
- **Research defunding:** Mobilize public/private support for alignment work
- **Near-miss clustering:** Interpret as "we're in thin branch"; increase coordination urgency
- **Decision paralysis:** Activate emergency decision-making procedures

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Annual assessment + Continuous near-miss tracking
