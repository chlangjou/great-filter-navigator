## Dashboard Overview

This dashboard provides a single-view status of how each Great Filter response is performing.

**Color coding:**
- 🟢 **Green (✅):** Response is successful / metrics in safe range
- 🟡 **Yellow (⚠️):** Response showing warning signs / metrics approaching thresholds
- 🔴 **Red (❌):** Response failing / metrics critical / immediate action required

## Critical Alerts

**Respond immediately to:**
- Any 🔴 Red status metrics
- Multiple 🟡 Yellow metrics in single response
- Yellow metrics trending toward Red
- Unexpected metric degradations

---

## Feedback Loop

When metrics change:

1. **Green → Yellow:** Investigate cause; activate response investigation; may implement precautions
2. **Yellow → Red:** Activate emergency protocols; convene decision-making body; prepare response adjustments
3. **Red → Green:** Document success; learn lessons; update protocols accordingly
4. **Metric drift:** Analyze trend; adjust response or re-evaluate threat assessment

---

## Data Sources

**Automated real-time sources:**
- System logs and monitoring dashboards
- Power consumption tracking
