# HOW TO EVALUATE: C1 Computational Limits

**Response Protocol:** Resource allocation and graceful degradation framework

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Budget Compliance (Continuous)
**How:** Track global computational usage vs. established budget
**Success:** Consistently <0.005% of universe capacity

### 2. Graceful Degradation (Semi-annual)
**How:** Stress-test systems with reduced resources; measure functionality at 50%
**Success:** All core systems operational at 50% resource availability

### 3. Priority Protection (Quarterly)
**How:** Audit that survival-critical systems receive protected allocation
**Success:** >90% protection from rationing

### 4. Efficiency Optimization (Annual)
**How:** Measure computational efficiency gains without increasing footprint
**Success:** >5% efficiency improvement annually

## Warning Signs

- Budget usage creeping toward limits
- Systems crashing under resource constraints
- Efficiency gains plateauing
- ASI expressing dissatisfaction with limits

---

## Implementation

**Continuous:** Resource accounting + Budget enforcement  
**Semi-annual:** Stress testing  
**Quarterly:** Priority audit  
**Annual:** Efficiency review

**Success** = Operate sustainably within computational envelope; maintain core functionality

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Continuous + Annual comprehensive review
