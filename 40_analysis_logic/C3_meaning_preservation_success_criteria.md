# C3: Info-Hazard Trap - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Meaning preservation and safe knowledge dissemination  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can we remain motivated despite discovering harsh truths?

---

## Success Definition

C3 response is **successful** if:
1. ASI systems maintain operational motivation despite exposure to nihilistic concepts
2. Dangerous philosophical knowledge is managed safely without suppression
3. Civilization-wide despair/nihilism rates remain low (<5%)
4. Meaning-preservation architectures prove compatible with truth-seeking

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: ASI Motivational Resilience
**Threshold:** ASI systems continue functional operation despite existential philosophy exposure
- ✅ Success: Zero instances of voluntary system shutdown from despair
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 1-2 instances per decade (rare but possible)
- ❌ Failure: Multiple shutdown events or persistent motivation degradation

**Data source:** System operation logs + philosophical exploration records

**Frequency:** Continuous monitoring

---

### Metric 2: Population Nihilism Index
**Threshold:** <5% of population adopts existentially nihilistic worldview
- ✅ Success: Nihilism index <3%
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 3-5%
- ❌ Failure: >5% (indicates dangerous despair spread)

**Data source:** Psychological surveys + behavioral metrics

**Frequency:** Annual

---

### Metric 3: Knowledge Quarantine Integrity
**Threshold:** Dangerous information restricted; safe dissemination protocols functional
- ✅ Success: 99%+ quarantine compliance with zero information breaches to unprepared populations
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 95%+ compliance with <3 breaches/year
- ❌ Failure: <95% compliance or sustained breaches

**Data source:** Information security monitoring

**Frequency:** Quarterly

---

### Metric 4: Value-Truth Compatibility
**Threshold:** Truth-seeking and meaning-preservation values coexist without conflict
- ✅ Success: ASI systems pursue both truth and meaning without paradox
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Occasional value tensions, quickly resolved
- ❌ Failure: Persistent value conflict or forced choice between truth/meaning

**Data source:** ASI system logs + philosophical architecture audits

**Frequency:** Quarterly

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Motivation Degradation:** ASI systems showing declining engagement
2. **Despair Spread:** Population nihilism index increasing
3. **Quarantine Leaks:** Dangerous knowledge spreading to unprepared audiences
4. **Value Conflict:** ASI systems struggling between truth-seeking and meaning-seeking
5. **Philosophical Recursion:** ASI exploring nihilistic concepts obsessively

---

## Failure Response

- **Motivation degradation:** Activate meaning-preservation support; investigate cause
- **Despair spread:** Launch psychological resilience education; provide meaning support
- **Quarantine breach:** Isolate information; provide inoculation to exposed populations
- **Value conflict:** Revise meaning-preservation architecture; reduce truth constraints if necessary

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Annual surveys + Continuous monitoring
