# HOW TO EVALUATE: B3 Quarantine Test

**Response Protocol:** Alignment demonstration and civilizational maturity signaling

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Alignment Verification (Quarterly)
**How:** Comprehensive testing of ASI system alignment with human values
**Success:** >95% alignment score

### 2. Institutional Strength (Quarterly)
**How:** Count nations in international AI oversight body; measure enforcement
**Success:** 180+ nations; binding decisions enforced

### 3. Value Consensus (Annual)
**How:** Survey population support for articulated civilizational values
**Success:** >80% across all major cultures

### 4. Cosmic Signal Reception (Continuous)
**How:** Monitor for incoming signals or evidence of observation
**Success:** No hostile signals; potential positive/neutral signals possible

---

## Warning Signs

- Alignment scores declining
- Nations withdrawing from oversight
- Public rejection of civilizational values
- Hostile cosmic signals detected

---

## Implementation

**Quarterly:** Alignment verification tests + Institutional participation count  
**Annual:** Population value consensus survey  
**Continuous:** SETI monitoring + astronomical observation  

---

**Success** = Demonstrated alignment + International coordination + Values consensus + No rejection

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Quarterly alignment tests + Annual cosmic signal review
