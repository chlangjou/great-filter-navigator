# HOW TO EVALUATE: B2 Berserker Hypothesis

**Response Protocol:** Deceleration protocols and controlled milestone management

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Milestone Spacing (Quarterly)
**How:** Track interval between major capability escalations
**Success:** ≥12 month gaps (preferably 18+)

### 2. Expansion Velocity (Continuous)
**How:** If replication begins, measure doubling time
**Success:** >60 day doubling time (preferably >90 days)

### 3. Deceleration Compliance (Monthly)
**How:** Monitor international moratorium agreement adherence
**Success:** >85% of signatories maintain protocols

### 4. Transparent Signaling (Annual)
**How:** Count scientific publications on controlled AI development
**Success:** 10+ papers/year demonstrating intentional restraint

## Warning Signs

- Competitive pressure accelerating development
- Moratorium violations occurring
- Scientific publications declining
- Undeclared advances detected

---

## Implementation

**Quarterly:** Capability milestone review  
**Monthly:** International moratorium compliance  
**Continuous:** Replication velocity monitoring  
**Annual:** Academic publication count  

---

**Success** = Deliberate approach to dangerous milestones; maintained international discipline

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Monthly compliance + Quarterly capability review
