# HOW TO EVALUATE: C4 Inward Turn

**Response Protocol:** Cosmic expansion commitment and digital-physical balance

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Expansion Milestone Achievement (Annual)
**How:** Track progress on planned cosmic development milestones
**Success:** All planned milestones achieved on schedule

### 2. Population Distribution (Annual)
**How:** Survey what % of population chooses physical vs. digital existence
**Success:** >50% remain committed to physical reality

### 3. Expansion Funding (Annual Budget)
**How:** Track % of global GDP allocated to space exploration
**Success:** 1-3% of global GDP

### 4. Institutional Balance (Annual)
**How:** Assess health of both digital and physical expansion institutions
**Success:** Both thriving; neither dominated the other

---

## Warning Signs

- Population digital preference >50%
- Space exploration funding declining
- Planned milestones being delayed
- Physical expansion advocates losing influence
- Constitutional amendments to expansion values proposed

---

## Implementation

**Annual:** Milestone tracking + Population surveys  
**Annual:** Budget analysis  
**Quarterly:** Institutional health review  

---

**Success** = Achieve cosmic expansion milestones; maintain population diversity; steady funding

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Quarterly institutional review + Annual comprehensive assessment
