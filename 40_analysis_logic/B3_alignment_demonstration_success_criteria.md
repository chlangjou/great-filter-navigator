# B3: Quarantine Test - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Alignment demonstration and civilizational maturity signaling  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can we demonstrate we're worthy of cosmic community membership?

---

## Success Definition

B3 response is **successful** if:
1. ASI alignment is demonstrably achieved and verifiable
2. International coordination bodies are established and functional
3. Civilizational values are articulated and widely endorsed
4. No explicit rejection signals received from space (no evidence of failure)

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Alignment Verification
**Threshold:** ASI systems pass comprehensive alignment tests
- ✅ Success: All ASI systems >95% alignment score
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 85-95% alignment
- ❌ Failure: <85% alignment (indicates test failure)

**Data source:** Comprehensive alignment testing protocols

**Frequency:** Quarterly

---

### Metric 2: International Institutional Strength
**Threshold:** Global AI oversight body is functional and respected
- ✅ Success: 180+ nations participate, binding decisions enforced
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 150-180 nations, soft enforcement
- ❌ Failure: <150 nations or no enforcement

**Data source:** Institutional records + participation tracking

**Frequency:** Quarterly

---

### Metric 3: Value Consensus Endorsement
**Threshold:** >80% population supports articulated civilizational values
- ✅ Success: 85%+ support across all major cultures
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 75-85% support
- ❌ Failure: <75% support (values not legitimate)

**Data source:** Survey data + democratic processes

**Frequency:** Annual

---

### Metric 4: Cosmic Signal Reception
**Threshold:** No hostile signals received; potential response signals possible
- ✅ Success: No hostile detection; potential positive signals
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Ambiguous signals (continue monitoring)
- ❌ Failure: Explicit rejection or hostile signals

**Data source:** SETI monitoring + astronomical observations

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Alignment Regression:** Scores declining despite efforts
2. **International Breakdown:** Nations withdraw from oversight agreements
3. **Value Dispute:** Public rejection of civilizational values increases
4. **Institutional Failure:** Oversight body becomes ineffective or captured
5. **Anomalous Signals:** Unexplained cosmic phenomena suggest observation

---

## Failure Response

- **Alignment failure:** Return to A1/A2/A3 responses; strengthen alignment work
- **International breakdown:** Rebuild consensus; may shift to B1 stealth strategy
- **Value rejection:** Democratic deliberation on whether values are legitimate
- **Cosmic rejection signals:** Shift to B1 stealth or prepare B4 constraints

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Quarterly alignment tests + Annual cosmic signal review
