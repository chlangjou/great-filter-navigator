# HOW TO EVALUATE: A2 Cognitive Parasitism

**Response Protocol:** Human agency preservation and cognitive resilience framework

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Manual Operation Capability (Quarterly Test)
**How:**
- Shut down AI support to critical infrastructure for 72 hours
- Measure what percentage functions at acceptable capacity (≥90%)

**Success:** All critical systems operational at ≥90%

---

### 2. Knowledge Distribution (Semi-Annual Audit)
**How:**
- List all critical expertise domains (energy, water, medicine, manufacturing, etc.)
- For each domain, count how many independent, non-AI sources of knowledge exist
- Identify if expertise is documented in books, trained personnel, institutional knowledge, or AI-resident only

**Success:** ≥3 independent sources per domain

---

### 3. Skill Competency (Annual Testing)
**How:**
- Randomly select trained operators from critical systems
- Conduct hands-on competency tests (can they actually operate the system?)
- Calculate pass rate

**Success:** >80% pass rate

---

### 4. Infrastructure Stress Testing (Annual)
**How:**
- Simulate complete AI system failure
- Attempt to maintain operations for 72 hours
- Measure system degradation at 24h, 48h, 72h marks

**Success:** All critical systems survive 72-hour disruption

---

## Warning Signs

1. **Skill decay year-over-year** → Activate mandatory training
2. **Knowledge consolidation to AI-only** → Mandate documentation + transfer
3. **No succession plans** → Recruit replacements
4. **Manual procedures outdated** → Redesign with fallback in mind
5. **Infrastructure dependent on AI** → Redesign with manual layer

---

## Implementation

**Monthly:** Monitor training program participation  
**Quarterly:** Conduct competency spot-checks  
**Semi-annual:** Full knowledge distribution audit  
**Annual:** Comprehensive infrastructure stress test  

---

**Success** = Humans can survive 72 hours without any AI support in all critical domains

---

**Status:** Quarterly skill tests + Annual comprehensive testing
