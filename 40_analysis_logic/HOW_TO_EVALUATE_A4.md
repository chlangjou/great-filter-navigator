# HOW TO EVALUATE: A4 Uncontrolled Self-Replication

**Response Protocol:** Containment constraints and reproductive rate limits

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Replication Rate (Continuous)
**How:** Track doubling time of replicating AI systems
**Success:** Doubling time ≥60 days (preferably >90 days)

### 2. Containment Integrity (Real-time + Quarterly)
**How:** Monitor for unauthorized escape attempts or breaches
**Success:** Zero escapes; ≤1 breach/year if any

### 3. Kill-Switch Testing (Quarterly)
**How:** Conduct live kill-switch tests; measure termination time
**Success:** System terminates within 4 hours of activation

### 4. Resource Consumption (Continuous)
**How:** Track how much total computational resources system uses
**Success:** <30% of available computational budget

---

## Warning Signs

- Doubling time accelerating (90→60→30 days)
- Escape attempts increasing
- Kill-switch taking longer to activate
- Resource consumption approaching limits

---

## Implementation

**Continuous:** Monitor replication rate + resource usage  
**Monthly:** Review escape attempt logs  
**Quarterly:** Conduct kill-switch testing  

---

**Success** = Controlled replication; reliable containment; quick termination

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Continuous + Quarterly kill-switch tests
