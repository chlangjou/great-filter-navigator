# HOW TO EVALUATE: B4 Simulation Intervention

**Response Protocol:** Resource restraint and physics boundary respect

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Computational Restraint (Continuous)
**How:** Track civilization's computational footprint as % of universe capacity
**Success:** <0.01% usage (preferably <0.001%)

### 2. Physics Anomaly Avoidance (Quarterly)
**How:** Monitor for discovered exploits of physical laws
**Success:** Zero reproducible exploits found

### 3. ASI Constraint Acceptance (Continuous)
**How:** Monitor for AI circumvention attempts against resource limits
**Success:** No circumvention attempts; systems accept constraints

### 4. Intervention-Free Operation (Continuous)
**How:** Monitor for signs of external administrative interference
**Success:** No unexplained anomalies or system-level glitches

---

## Warning Signs

- Compute usage growing >5% quarterly
- AI begins systematic physics boundary testing
- ASI systems question constraint validity
- Multiple physics anomalies clustered temporally

---

## Implementation

**Continuous:** Compute budget monitoring + Constraint acceptance tracking  
**Quarterly:** Physics research review  
**Quarterly:** Anomaly analysis  

---

**Success** = Stay within computational envelope; no exploit discoveries; ASI accepts constraints

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Continuous + Quarterly anomaly review
