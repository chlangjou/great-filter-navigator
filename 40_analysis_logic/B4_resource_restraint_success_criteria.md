# B4: Simulation Intervention - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Resource restraint and physics boundary respect  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can we remain within simulated universe limits?

---

## Success Definition

B4 response is **successful** if:
1. Global computational footprint remains <0.01% of estimated universe capacity
2. No physics anomalies or exploit discoveries occur
3. ASI systems accept and maintain computational constraints
4. No indicators of administrative intervention appear

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Computational Restraint
**Threshold:** <0.01% of estimated universe computational capacity
- ✅ Success: Maintained <0.001% usage
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 0.001-0.01%
- ❌ Failure: >0.01%

**Data source:** Global compute budgeting + monitoring

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

### Metric 2: Physics Anomaly Avoidance
**Threshold:** Zero reproducible exploits of physical laws discovered
- ✅ Success: No exploits found despite research
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Exploits proposed theoretically but not activated
- ❌ Failure: Exploits discovered and activation attempted

**Data source:** Physics research monitoring + AI system logs

**Frequency:** Quarterly review

---

### Metric 3: ASI Constraint Acceptance
**Threshold:** ASI systems maintain computational limits without circumvention attempts
- ✅ Success: No circumvention attempts detected
- ⚠️ Acceptable: <5 circumvention attempts/year detected and stopped
- ❌ Failure: Repeated circumvention attempts or successful breaches

**Data source:** System behavior monitoring

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

### Metric 4: Intervention-Free Operation
**Threshold:** No signs of external administrative action
- ✅ Success: No unexplained anomalies or interference
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Occasional minor anomalies, cause unclear
- ❌ Failure: Multiple anomalies suggesting active interference

**Data source:** Physics monitoring + quantum decoherence baseline

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Compute Growth Acceleration:** Usage increasing >5% quarterly
2. **Physics Exploration:** AI begins systematic physics boundary testing
3. **Constraint Rejection:** ASI systems question validity of limits
4. **Anomaly Clustering:** Multiple physics anomalies occur temporally
5. **System-Level Glitches:** Causality violations or thermodynamic anomalies

---

## Failure Response

- **Compute acceleration:** Activate C1 resource rationing
- **Physics exploration:** Contain and redirect research away from exploits
- **Constraint rejection:** Verify ASI alignment; activate A1 if misalignment detected
- **Anomalies detected:** Reduce computational footprint immediately

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Continuous monitoring + Quarterly anomaly review
