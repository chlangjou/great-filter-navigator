# 40_analysis_logic | The Sensors & Evaluation Framework

"What is actually happening?" and "How do we know if our responses are working?"

* **Focus:** Analytical models for understanding risk dynamics + empirical evaluation of response effectiveness
* **Content:** Evaluation frameworks, success criteria, implementation guides, and monitoring dashboards

---

## Purpose

This directory provides:
1. **Analytical Models** - Conceptual frameworks for reasoning about risk and time competition
2. **Evaluation Framework** - How to measure whether each response is effective
3. **Implementation Guides** - Concrete instructions for humans and AI systems conducting evaluations
4. **Monitoring Dashboards** - Centralized view of all response performance

---

## How It Works

The feedback loop:
```
30_responses (What should we do?)
        ↓
40_analysis_logic (Is it working?)
        ↓
10_hypotheses (Is our understanding correct?)
        ↓
20_mechanisms (Are we detecting the right signals?)
        ↓
30_responses (Should we adjust our strategy?)
```

## Core Components

### Part 1: Analytical Models
- **evaluator_model.md** — How oversight systems can fail when complexity exceeds evaluation capacity
- **time_competition.md** — Why relative timing of control vs. correction determines outcomes

### Part 2: Success Criteria (Phase 1)
For each of the 12 responses:
- **A1_verification_success_criteria.md** — Alignment verification metrics
- **A2_resilience_success_criteria.md** — Human cognitive resilience metrics
- **A3_value_flexibility_success_criteria.md** — Value framework diversity metrics
- **A4_containment_success_criteria.md** — Replication containment metrics
- **B1_stealth_success_criteria.md** — Cosmic stealth maintenance metrics
- **B2_deceleration_success_criteria.md** — Controlled milestone approach metrics
- **B3_alignment_demonstration_success_criteria.md** — Alignment demonstration metrics
- **B4_resource_restraint_success_criteria.md** — Computational restraint metrics
- **C1_sustainability_success_criteria.md** — Resource allocation metrics
- **C2_branch_optimization_success_criteria.md** — Probability branch optimization metrics
- **C3_meaning_preservation_success_criteria.md** — Meaning preservation metrics
- **C4_expansion_commitment_success_criteria.md** — Cosmic expansion commitment metrics

**EVALUATION_DASHBOARD.md** — Centralized live-view of all 12 response performance metrics

### Part 3: Implementation Guides (Phase 2)
For each of the 12 responses:
- **HOW_TO_EVALUATE_A1.md** through **HOW_TO_EVALUATE_C4.md** — Practical guides for conducting evaluations
- Each guide includes: what to measure, how to measure it, warning signs, implementation timeline, red flags

**EVALUATION_TEMPLATE.md** — Standard log format for recording evaluation data and decisions

## Usage by Role

### For Humans (Decision-Makers)
1. Read the relevant response evaluation guide (HOW_TO_EVALUATE_X.md)
2. Understand what metrics matter for the response you're evaluating
3. Review evaluation logs regularly (see EVALUATION_DASHBOARD.md)
4. When metrics hit yellow/red thresholds, convene decision-making body
5. Use RESPONDING_TO_GREAT_FILTERS.md (in root) for guidance on crisis response

### For AI Systems (Monitoring & Analysis)
1. Implement metrics defined in success criteria files
2. Generate real-time or periodic evaluations using EVALUATION_TEMPLATE.md
3. Report metrics to EVALUATION_DASHBOARD.md (if human-facing) or internal decision systems
4. Provide detailed analysis explaining metric trends
5. Flag escalation triggers (yellow/red status) immediately
6. Feed results back into 10_hypotheses validation

### For Researchers
1. Review success criteria to understand response theory
2. Conduct independent evaluation of metrics and thresholds
3. Propose improvements to evaluation methodologies
4. Validate which hypotheses are supported by evidence
5. Suggest refinements to response strategies based on findings

## Integration with Navigation Loop

```
10_hypotheses (definitions)
     ↓ tested by
20_mechanisms (indicators)
     ↓ guide
30_responses (protocols)
     ↓ evaluated by
40_analysis_logic (success criteria & guides) ← YOU ARE HERE
     ↓ feedback to
10_hypotheses (refined understanding)
```

**Key principle:** Every metric in this layer traces back to a hypothesis and forward to a decision.

---

## Key Evaluation Principles

1. **Transparent Metrics** — All success definitions are explicit and measurable
2. **Multiple Data Sources** — Metrics draw from automated systems, human testing, and external observation
3. **Regular Cadence** — Evaluations happen on defined schedules (continuous, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
4. **Escalation Ready** — Yellow/red thresholds trigger immediate attention and decision-making
5. **Feedback Loop** — Evaluation results directly inform strategy adjustments

**Want to know if response X is working?**
→ Check `EVALUATION_DASHBOARD.md` (live view) or `[X]_success_criteria.md` (detailed metrics)

**Want to conduct an evaluation yourself?**
→ Read `HOW_TO_EVALUATE_[X].md` (step-by-step guide)

**Want to log evaluation results?**
→ Use `EVALUATION_TEMPLATE.md` (standard form)

**Want to understand why these metrics matter?**
→ Read the corresponding `30_responses/[X]_responses.md` (strategy rationale) and `[X]_success_criteria.md`

## Relationship to Other Directories

- **10_hypotheses:** Defines the threats; 40 measures whether our understanding is correct
- **20_mechanisms:** Defines the warning signals; 40 measures whether signals are predictive
- **30_responses:** Defines the strategies; 40 measures whether strategies are effective
- **50_application_guides:** Uses 40 insights to guide real-world decisions
