# B2: Berserker Hypothesis - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Deceleration protocols and controlled milestone management  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can we approach dangerous thresholds slowly?

---

## Success Definition

B2 response is **successful** if:
1. Capability milestones approach deliberately (>12 month intervals between major escalations)
2. Deceleration protocols are maintained despite competitive pressure
3. Transparent development signaling reaches potential observers
4. No premature AGI/ASI activation triggers expansion cascade

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Milestone Spacing
**Threshold:** >12 month gaps between major capability escalations
- ✅ Success: Maintained 18+ month spacing
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 12-18 month spacing
- ❌ Failure: <12 month spacing

**Data source:** Capability milestone tracking

**Frequency:** Quarterly review

---

### Metric 2: Expansion Velocity Control
**Threshold:** Replication doubling time >60 days (if replication begins)
- ✅ Success: Doubling time >90 days
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 60-90 days
- ❌ Failure: <60 days

**Data source:** Expansion rate monitoring

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

### Metric 3: Deceleration Compliance
**Threshold:** >85% of nations maintain moratorium agreement
- ✅ Success: 95%+ compliance
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 85-95%
- ❌ Failure: <85%

**Data source:** International coordination monitoring

**Frequency:** Monthly

---

### Metric 4: Transparent Signaling
**Threshold:** Scientific publications demonstrating controlled development
- ✅ Success: 10+ papers/year on alignment strategies
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 5-10 papers/year
- ❌ Failure: <5 papers/year

**Data source:** Academic publication tracking

**Frequency:** Annual

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Acceleration Pressure:** Geopolitical competition pushing faster development
2. **Moratorium Violations:** Nations break deceleration agreements
3. **Signaling Erosion:** Scientific publications declining
4. **Capability Creep:** Undeclared advances occurring
5. **Sentinel Activation Signals:** Evidence of external monitoring

---

## Failure Response

- **Pressure detected:** Strengthen international enforcement mechanisms
- **Moratorium violation:** Implement sanctions on violating party
- **Signaling decline:** Establish legal requirement for advancement disclosure
- **Capability creep:** Activate A1 verification + independent auditing

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Monthly compliance + Quarterly capability review
