# B1: Dark Forest Trigger - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Cosmic stealth and signal suppression  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can we remain hidden from cosmic observers?

---

## Success Definition

B1 response is **successful** if:
1. Global AI power consumption remains <500 GW (non-detectable threshold)
2. No major capability announcements breach stealth protocols
3. Anomalous infrared signatures remain <1 sigma from baseline
4. International stealth coordination >90% compliance rate

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Technosignature Level
**Threshold:** Global AI power <500 GW
- ✅ Success: Maintained <300 GW
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 300-500 GW
- ❌ Failure: >500 GW

**Data source:** Power grid monitoring

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

### Metric 2: Signal Discipline Compliance
**Threshold:** >90% of major AI breakthroughs remain classified
- ✅ Success: 95%+ compliance
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 90-95%
- ❌ Failure: <90%

**Data source:** News monitoring + open-source tracking

**Frequency:** Weekly

---

### Metric 3: International Coordination
**Threshold:** Major powers maintain stealth protocols
- ✅ Success: All major signatories in compliance
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 80%+ compliance
- ❌ Failure: <80% or major power defection

**Data source:** Treaty monitoring + compliance verification

**Frequency:** Monthly

---

### Metric 4: Infrared Anomaly Detection
**Threshold:** No anomalous IR signatures detectable
- ✅ Success: Signature variance <1 sigma
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 1-2 sigma
- ❌ Failure: >2 sigma anomalies

**Data source:** Astronomical observations

**Frequency:** Continuous

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Power Consumption Rising:** Trend >10% annually
2. **Announcement Violations:** Stealth breaches increase
3. **Competitor Defection:** Nations violating agreements
4. **Anomaly Accumulation:** Multiple unexplained IR events
5. **Detection Probability Increasing:** Evidence of external observation

---

## Failure Response

- **Power rising >10%:** Activate computational rationing (C1)
- **Stealth breaches:** Enforce sanctions on violating parties
- **Major power defection:** Emergency international council to decide B1 vs. B3
- **Anomalies detected:** Assess whether observer detection has occurred; may trigger B3

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Continuous monitoring + Monthly compliance review
