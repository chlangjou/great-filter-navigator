# C4: Inward Turn - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Cosmic expansion commitment and digital-physical balance  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can we maintain commitment to cosmic expansion despite digital temptation?

---

## Success Definition

C4 response is **successful** if:
1. Civilization maintains constitutional commitment to cosmic expansion
2. Population remains balanced between digital and physical existence (no total retreat)
3. Space exploration programs continue with stable or increasing funding
4. Expansion milestones are achieved on schedule

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Expansion Milestone Achievement
**Threshold:** Major cosmic development milestones reached on schedule
- ✅ Success: All planned milestones achieved on time (Moon base, Mars settlement, etc.)
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Milestones achieved with 1-2 year delays
- ❌ Failure: Milestones repeatedly delayed or cancelled

**Data source:** Space program tracking + milestone logging

**Frequency:** Annual review

---

### Metric 2: Population Distribution
**Threshold:** No more than 50% of population chooses digital existence
- ✅ Success: 60%+ remain in physical reality
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 50-60% physical presence
- ❌ Failure: <50% in physical reality (total retreat)

**Data source:** Population preference surveys + digital/physical investment ratios

**Frequency:** Annual

---

### Metric 3: Resource Allocation Balance
**Threshold:** Space exploration maintains 1-3% of global GDP allocation
- ✅ Success: Maintained 2-3% allocation
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 1-2% allocation
- ❌ Failure: <1% or declining trend

**Data source:** Government budget tracking

**Frequency:** Annual

---

### Metric 4: Digital-Physical Competition Intensity
**Threshold:** Institutional structures maintain healthy competition between digital/physical priorities
- ✅ Success: Both are thriving; no single winner
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Some resource tension but mutual survival
- ❌ Failure: Digital completely dominates; physical infrastructure neglected

**Data source:** Institutional analysis + investment tracking

**Frequency:** Annual

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Digital Preference Rising:** Population increasingly choosing digital existence
2. **Space Funding Declining:** Budget cuts to expansion programs
3. **Milestone Delays:** Planned expansions being postponed
4. **Institutional Conflict:** Physical expansion advocates losing influence
5. **Constitutional Erosion:** Expansion value amendments being proposed

---

## Failure Response

- **Digital dominance detected:** Activate expansion incentives (education, prestige, resources)
- **Space funding cut:** Public mobilization to restore funding
- **Milestone delays:** Emergency resources to restore timeline
- **Constitutional attack:** Defend expansion values; require supermajority amendment requirement

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Annual comprehensive review + Quarterly milestone tracking
