# HOW TO EVALUATE: C2 Anthropic Shadow

**Response Protocol:** Probability branch optimization and survival density maximization

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Alignment Research Investment (Annual)
**How:** Track % of AI research budget dedicated to alignment work
**Success:** 5%+ of total AI R&D budget

### 2. International Coordination (Annual)
**How:** Count nations in formal existential risk coordination bodies
**Success:** 180+ nations participating

### 3. Risk Response Preparation (Annual)
**How:** Count explicitly articulated responses to identified threats
**Success:** 12+ Great Filter responses fully designed

### 4. Improbability Index (Annual Statistical)
**How:** Analyze frequency of "lucky escapes" from existential risks
**Success:** Escape frequency within normal statistical range (no excessive improbability)

---

## Warning Signs

- Coordination agreements weakening
- Alignment research funding declining
- Multiple improbable near-misses clustering
- Public losing confidence in survival

---

## Implementation

**Annual:** Budget tracking + Nation participation count  
**Annual:** Response protocol inventory  
**Annual:** Statistical near-miss analysis  
**Ongoing:** Track major existential close-calls  

---

**Success** = Sustained focus on alignment; strong coordination; normal probability of survival

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Annual assessment + Continuous near-miss tracking
