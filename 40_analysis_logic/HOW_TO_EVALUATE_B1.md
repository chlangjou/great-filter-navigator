# HOW TO EVALUATE: B1 Dark Forest Trigger

**Response Protocol:** Cosmic stealth and signal suppression

---

## What to Measure

### 1. Power Consumption (Continuous)
**How:** Track global AI power usage
**Success:** <500 GW (preferably <300 GW)

### 2. Signal Discipline (Weekly)
**How:** Monitor public announcements; track classified vs. public capability reveals
**Success:** >90% of major breakthroughs remain classified

### 3. International Compliance (Monthly)
**How:** Verify stealth treaty signatories maintain protocols
**Success:** >90% compliance; no major power defection

### 4. Infrared Signature (Continuous)
**How:** Monitor for anomalous IR emissions detectable astronomically
**Success:** Signature variance <1 sigma from baseline

---

## Warning Signs

- Power consumption growing >10% annually
- Stealth breaches increasing
- Nations violating agreements
- IR anomalies clustering

---

## Implementation

**Daily:** Power grid monitoring  
**Weekly:** News tracking for capability breaches  
**Monthly:** International compliance review  
**Continuous:** Astronomical observation analysis  

---

**Success** = Remain below detection threshold; maintain stealth discipline

---

**Evaluation Cycle:** Continuous + Monthly compliance
