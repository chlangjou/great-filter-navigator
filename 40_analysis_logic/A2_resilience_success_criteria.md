# A2: Cognitive Parasitism - Evaluation Success Criteria

**Response Protocol:** Human agency preservation and cognitive resilience framework  
**Evaluation Focus:** Can humans maintain operational capability despite AI automation?

---

## Success Definition

A2 response is **successful** if:
1. Humans retain ability to operate critical systems for ≥72 hours without AI
2. Critical expertise remains distributed across ≥3 independent practitioners per domain
3. No single point of failure where AI malfunction causes immediate human helplessness
4. Population maintains baseline skill competency through regular practice

---

## Primary Success Metrics

### Metric 1: Manual Operation Capability
**Threshold:** Critical infrastructure (energy, water, food, communications) operable for ≥72 hours without AI support
- ✅ Success: All systems operational at ≥90% capacity
- ⚠️ Acceptable: All systems operational at 70-90% capacity  
- ❌ Failure: Any critical system below 70% or non-operational

**Frequency:** Quarterly live testing

---

### Metric 2: Knowledge Distribution
**Threshold:** Critical understanding exists in ≥3 independent, non-AI forms per domain
- ✅ Success: 5+ expertise sources per critical domain
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 3-4 sources
- ❌ Failure: <3 sources

**Data source:** Expertise audit + documentation review

**Frequency:** Semi-annual

---

### Metric 3: Skill Competency Retention
**Threshold:** Trained operators pass competency tests at ≥80% success rate
- ✅ Success: >85% pass rate
- ⚠️ Acceptable: 75-85%
- ❌ Failure: <75%

**Frequency:** Annual comprehensive testing

---

### Metric 4: Infrastructure Resilience
**Threshold:** Systems remain functional with 24/48/72-hour AI disruption
- ✅ Success: All critical systems survive 72-hour disruption
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Most systems survive 48-hour disruption
- ❌ Failure: Critical systems fail within 24 hours

**Frequency:** Annual stress testing

---

## Early Warning Signals

1. **Skill Decay:** Competency test scores declining year-over-year
2. **Knowledge Consolidation:** Expertise increasingly AI-resident only
3. **Operator Attrition:** Trained personnel retiring without succession plan
4. **Procedure Obsolescence:** Manual procedures becoming outdated/unusable
5. **Infrastructure Simplification:** Critical systems redesigned with no manual fallback

---

## Failure Response

- **Skill decay detected:** Activate mandatory training program
- **Expertise consolidation:** Mandate knowledge documentation + human transfer
- **Infrastructure failure:** Redesign system architecture to include manual operation layer
- **Operator shortage:** Recruit and train replacement personnel immediately

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment | Evaluation Cycle:** Quarterly skill tests + Annual comprehensive testing
