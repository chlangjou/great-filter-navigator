## 2026 Decisions

### 2026-02-15: UAP Contact Integration - Supplementary Analysis

**Status:** ✅ **ADOPTED**

**Proposal:** UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) Contact Integration Framework

**Context:**
- U.S. government disclosure of military UAP incidents creates opportunity for framework testing
- UAP evidence provides empirical data for hypotheses previously theoretical
- Need to integrate contact scenarios into GFN without invalidating existing framework
- Emphasis on supplementary analysis rather than core framework revision

**Decision:** **SUPPLEMENT, NOT REVISE**
- Maintain core hypothesis integrity (B1, B3, Observer Hypothesis unchanged)
- Add contact scenario analysis as conditional branches
- Create new supplementary file for UAP-specific analysis
- Enhance supporting documentation without rewriting foundations

**Rationale:**
1. Contact evidence strengthens rather than weakens Dark Forest hypothesis (demonstrates peaceful coexistence possible)
2. Contact supports Quarantine hypothesis by providing empirical test data
3. Contact enhances Observer Hypothesis fine-tuning argument (multiple coexisting civilizations more improbable)
4. Supplementary approach preserves framework stability while enabling evolution
5. Maintains scientific caution: interprets evidence without overreach

**Implementation Completed:**
- ✅ B1_dark_forest_trigger.md: Added "UAP Contact Integration: Dark Forest Mitigation Routes" section
- ✅ B3_quarantine_hypothesis.md: Added "UAP Contact as Possible Test Manifestation" section
- ✅ OBSERVER_HYPOTHESIS_FRAMEWORK.md: Enhanced fine-tuning Pillar 1 with multi-civilization evidence
- ✅ New file created: 00_scope/76_uap_contact_framework.md (comprehensive scenario analysis)
- ✅ decision_log.md: This entry recording decision

**Version Impact:** GFN Framework remains v1.x; enhancement does not trigger major version bump

**Post-Implementation Notes:**
- Framework shows good adaptability to new empirical data
- Supplementary approach proved effective for integrating paradigm-adjacent evidence
- Future contact developments can be integrated similarly
- Community ready for post-disclosure civilization navigation phase

## Decision Principles

**What we use to make framework evolution decisions:**

1. **Transparency** - All decisions documented with full rationale
2. **Community input** - Major weight given to community feedback
3. **Technical merit** - Solutions evaluated on architectural quality
4. **Backward compatibility** - Existing work preserved where possible
5. **Resource realism** - Decisions account for actual available resources
6. **Reversibility** - Where possible, decisions made reversible or deferrable

---

## Appeal Process

**If you disagree with a decision:**

1. Document specific concerns in writing
2. Tag issue [FRAMEWORK_DECISION_APPEAL]
3. Core team reviews appeal within 2 weeks
4. If new evidence presented, decision may be revisited
5. Final appeal to wider community if needed

---

## Lessons Learned

*[To be accumulated as we make decisions]*

### About Framework Governance

- [ ] How long should review periods be? (Currently 2 weeks)
- [ ] What percentage consensus is enough? (Currently 70%)
- [ ] How frequently can we handle major changes? (Currently quarterly)
- [ ] How do we balance speed vs deliberation? (TBD)

---

## Metrics for Success

**After each major framework upgrade:**

- ✅ Framework solves identified problems
- ✅ Community understands change rationale
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ No critical regressions introduced
- ✅ Implementation on schedule and budget
- ✅ Community satisfaction with new version

---

**Framework governance is an ongoing process of learning and improvement.** 🧬
