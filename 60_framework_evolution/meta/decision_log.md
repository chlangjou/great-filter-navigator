## Decision Principles

**What we use to make framework evolution decisions:**

1. **Transparency** - All decisions documented with full rationale
2. **Community input** - Major weight given to community feedback
3. **Technical merit** - Solutions evaluated on architectural quality
4. **Backward compatibility** - Existing work preserved where possible
5. **Resource realism** - Decisions account for actual available resources
6. **Reversibility** - Where possible, decisions made reversible or deferrable

---

## Appeal Process

**If you disagree with a decision:**

1. Document specific concerns in writing
2. Tag issue [FRAMEWORK_DECISION_APPEAL]
3. Core team reviews appeal within 2 weeks
4. If new evidence presented, decision may be revisited
5. Final appeal to wider community if needed

## Lessons Learned

*[To be accumulated as we make decisions]*

### About Framework Governance

- [ ] How long should review periods be? (Currently 2 weeks)
- [ ] What percentage consensus is enough? (Currently 70%)
- [ ] How frequently can we handle major changes? (Currently quarterly)
- [ ] How do we balance speed vs deliberation? (TBD)

## Metrics for Success

**After each major framework upgrade:**

- ✅ Framework solves identified problems
- ✅ Community understands change rationale
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ No critical regressions introduced
- ✅ Implementation on schedule and budget
- ✅ Community satisfaction with new version
