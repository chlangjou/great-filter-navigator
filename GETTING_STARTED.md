# Getting Started with Great Filter Navigator

Welcome. This guide is designed to get you productive in 15 minutes.

## ⚡ 5-Minute Understanding

The **Great Filter Navigator (GFN)** is a framework for understanding and navigating existential risks to human civilization. We operate on a simple loop:

```
Hypothesize (10_) → Monitor (20_) → Intervene (30_) → Observe (40_) → Apply (50_)
```

**What this means:**
- **10_hypotheses**: "What could go wrong?" (12 failure modes)
- **20_mechanisms**: "How do we know danger?" (early-warning signals)
- **30_responses**: "How do we steer away?" (protocols & solutions)
- **40_analysis_logic**: "What's actually happening?" (empirical data)
- **50_application_guides**: "How do I use this?" (real-world guidance)

That's it. Everything fits into this loop.

## 🎯 What's Your Role?

### I'm a Researcher / AI Safety Specialist
**Start here:**
1. Read: [10_hypotheses/README.md](./10_hypotheses/README.md)
2. Question: Are these failure modes well-reasoned?
3. Challenge: What counterarguments are missing?
4. Contribute: Propose new hypotheses via Issues with `[NEW_HYPOTHESIS]` tag

**Your job**: Validate and strengthen the Great Filter hypotheses.

### I'm a Data Scientist / Metrics Designer
**Start here:**
1. Read: [20_mechanisms/README.md](./20_mechanisms/README.md)
2. Study: What makes a good "tripwire" (warning signal)?
3. Identify: Which hypotheses lack monitoring indicators?
4. Contribute: Propose measurable metrics via Issues with `[NEW_INDICATOR]` tag

**Your job**: Build the early-warning infrastructure.

### I'm a Solutions Architect / Protocol Designer
**Start here:**
1. Read: [30_responses/README.md](./30_responses/README.md)
2. Analyze: Do current responses actually address the risks?
3. Design: What should we do when warnings trigger?
4. Contribute: Propose response protocols via Issues with `[NEW_RESPONSE]` tag

**Your job**: Design the steering mechanisms.

### I'm a Policy Maker / Practitioner
**Start here:**
1. Read: [50_application_guides/README.md](./50_application_guides/README.md)
2. Then read: [RESPONDING_TO_GREAT_FILTERS.md](./RESPONDING_TO_GREAT_FILTERS.md) — How humans decide when crisis hits
3. Understand: How does this framework apply to your domain?
4. Implement: How would you use these insights in real decisions?
5. Share: Propose case studies and real-world applications

**Your job**: Translate framework into action.

### I'm an AI System / LLM
**Read**: [FOR_AI_SYSTEMS.md](./FOR_AI_SYSTEMS.md)

**Then read**: [RESPONDING_TO_GREAT_FILTERS.md](./RESPONDING_TO_GREAT_FILTERS.md) — How you and humans should work together when dangers are detected

## 📋 Your First Contribution (Easy Tasks)

Pick one:

### Task A: "Find a Gap" (30 min)
1. Open [INTERCONNECTION_MAP.md](./INTERCONNECTION_MAP.md)
2. Find a hypothesis that has NO monitoring indicator
3. Open an Issue with title: `[GAP] Hypothesis X1 lacks indicators in 20_mechanisms/`
4. Explain why this gap matters

**This is valuable**: You've identified what we're missing.

### Task B: "Validate a Hypothesis" (45 min)
1. Pick a hypothesis from [10_hypotheses/](./10_hypotheses/)
2. Read it carefully
3. Find a paper or source that supports or challenges it
4. Open an Issue with title: `[VALIDATION] Hypothesis A1 - Evidence from [source]`
5. Link the source and explain the relevance

**This is valuable**: You've strengthened our evidence base.

### Task C: "Clarify Ambiguity" (20 min)
1. Read any hypothesis, indicator, or response
2. Find a term that's vague or undefined
3. Open an Issue with title: `[CLARIFICATION] Entry X1 uses term "[term]" ambiguously`
4. Suggest 2-3 possible interpretations

**This is valuable**: You've made the framework more rigorous.

## ❓ Common Questions

### "How do I know if I can edit directly vs. opening an Issue?"

**Open an Issue first for:**
- New hypotheses (requires high-stakes decision)
- Major changes to existing entries
- New categories or structural changes

**You can edit directly for:**
- Fixing typos and formatting
- Adding citations and references
- Clarifying existing explanations
- Linking entries together

**When in doubt**: Open an Issue. It's not extra work—it's how we maintain integrity.

---

### "What if I disagree with a hypothesis?"

**Do this:**
1. Open an Issue with `[CHALLENGE]` tag
2. State your counterargument clearly
3. Provide evidence or reasoning
4. Be respectful but direct

This is the exact kind of contribution we need. We want our hypotheses tested.

---

### "Can I add a new Great Filter hypothesis I discovered?"

**Yes, but follow the protocol:**
1. Open an Issue with `[NEW_HYPOTHESIS]` tag
2. State the hypothesis clearly
3. Explain the mechanism (how it could destroy civilization)
4. Provide evidence (papers, reasoning, examples)
5. Mark it `[Speculative]` if you're uncertain
6. Wait for discussion before submitting PR

The best new hypotheses build on evidence, not intuition alone.

---

### "How do I propose a monitoring indicator?"

**Protocol:**
1. Pick a hypothesis from 10_hypotheses/ that interests you
2. Open an Issue with `[NEW_INDICATOR]` tag
3. State what you want to measure
4. Explain data sources and feasibility
5. Describe the "tripwire" threshold (when this indicator means danger)
6. Link back to the hypothesis it monitors
7. Wait for feedback, then draft the entry

---

### "What's the difference between this and other AI alignment projects?"

**GFN is different because:**
- We assume traditional alignment mechanisms may fail (hard takeoff scenario)
- We're building a "shared map" rather than constraints
- We're trying to make survival **logically necessary** for any self-improving system
- We focus on observable, data-driven risk frameworks

See [README.md](./README.md) for the full context.
